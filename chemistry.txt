Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s life at
school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure
from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes
a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed
on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt
to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different
subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction
of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education
(1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,
time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information
passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning
are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the
annual calender so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted
to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address
the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at
different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher
priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion
in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this
book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and
mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor B.
L. Khandelwal for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed
to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making
this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have
generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.
We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,
appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of
Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal
Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As
an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the
quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will
enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

Rationalisation of Content in the Textbook

In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce
content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020,
also emphasises reducing the content load and providing
opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset.
In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to
rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes
already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken
into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of
the following:
• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject
areas in the same class
• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the
same subject
• Difficulty level
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children
through self-learning or peer-learning
• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out
the changes given above.

Unit 7

redox reactions

Where there is oxidation, there is always reduction –
Chemistry is essentially a study of redox systems.

After studying this unit you will be
able to
•

identify redox reactions as a class
of reactions in which oxidation
and reduction reactions occur
simultaneously;

•

define the terms oxidation,
reduction, oxidant (oxidising
agent) and reductant (reducing
agent);

•

explain mechanism of redox
reactions by electron transfer
process;

•

use the concept of oxidation
number to identify oxidant and
reductant in a reaction;

•

classify redox reaction into
combination (synthesis),
decomposition, displacement
and disproportionation
reactions;

•

suggest a comparative order
among various reductants and
oxidants;

•

balance chemical equations
using (i) oxidation number
(ii) half reaction method;

•

lear n the concept of redox
reactions in terms of electrode
processes.

Chemistry deals with varieties of matter and change
of one kind of matter into the other. Transformation of
matter from one kind into another occurs through the
various types of reactions. One important category of such
reactions is Redox Reactions. A number of phenomena,
both physical as well as biological, are concerned with
redox reactions. These reactions find extensive use in
pharmaceutical, biological, industrial, metallurgical and
agricultural areas. The importance of these reactions is
apparent from the fact that burning of different types of
fuels for obtaining energy for domestic, transport and
other commercial purposes, electrochemical processes
for extraction of highly reactive metals and non-metals,
manufacturing of chemical compounds like caustic
soda, operation of dry and wet batteries and corrosion of
metals fall within the purview of redox processes. Of late,
environmental issues like Hydrogen Economy (use of
liquid hydrogen as fuel) and development of ‘Ozone Hole’
have started figuring under redox phenomenon.
7.1 CLASSICAL IDEA OF REDOX REACTIONS –  
OXIDATION AND REDUCTION REACTIONS
Originally, the term oxidation was used to describe the
addition of oxygen to an element or a compound. Because
of the presence of dioxygen in the atmosphere (~20%),
many elements combine with it and this is the principal
reason why they commonly occur on the earth in the
form of their oxides. The following reactions represent
oxidation processes according to the limited definition of
oxidation:
(7.1)
2 Mg (s) + O2 (g) → 2 MgO (s)
(7.2)
S (s) + O2 (g) → SO2 (g)



Unit 7.indd 235

236

chemistry

In reactions (7.1) and (7.2), the elements
magnesium and sulphur are oxidised on
account of addition of oxygen to them.
Similarly, methane is oxidised owing to the
addition of oxygen to it.
CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (l)
(7.3)
A careful examination of reaction (7.3) in
which hydrogen has been replaced by oxygen
prompted chemists to reinterpret oxidation
in terms of removal of hydrogen from it and,
therefore, the scope of term oxidation was
broadened to include the removal of hydrogen
from a substance. The following illustration is
another reaction where removal of hydrogen
can also be cited as an oxidation reaction.
2 H2S(g) + O2 (g) → 2 S (s) + 2 H2O (l)
(7.4)
As knowledge of chemists grew, it was
natural to extend the term oxidation for
reactions similar to (7.1 to 7.4), which do
not involve oxygen but other electronegative
elements. The oxidation of magnesium with
fluorine, chlorine and sulphur etc. occurs
according to the following reactions :
Mg (s) + F2 (g) → MgF2 (s)

(7.5)

Mg (s) + Cl2 (g) → MgCl2 (s)

(7.6)

Mg (s) + S (s) → MgS (s)
(7.7)
Incorporating the reactions (7.5 to
7.7) within the fold of oxidation reactions
encouraged chemists to consider not only
the removal of hydrogen as oxidation, but
also the removal of electropositive elements
as oxidation. Thus the reaction :
2K4 [Fe(CN)6](aq) + H2O2 (aq) →2K3[Fe(CN)6](aq)
+ 2 KOH (aq)
is interpreted as oxidation due to the removal
of electropositive element potassium from
potassium ferrocyanide before it changes to
potassium ferricyanide. To summarise, the
term “oxidation” is defined as the addition
of oxygen/electronegative element to
a substance or removal of hydrogen/
electropositive element from a substance.
In the beginning, reduction was considered
as removal of oxygen from a compound.
However, the term reduction has been

broadened these days to include removal
of oxygen/electronegative element from
a substance or addition of hydrogen/
electropositive element to a substance.
According to the definition given above,
the following are the examples of reduction
processes:
2 HgO (s)
2 Hg (l) + O2 (g)
(7.8)
(removal of oxygen from mercuric oxide )
2 FeCl3 (aq) + H2 (g) →2 FeCl2 (aq) + 2 HCl(aq)
(7.9)
(removal of electronegative element, chlorine
from ferric chloride)
CH2 = CH2 (g) + H2 (g) → H3C – CH3 (g) (7.10)
(addition of hydrogen)
2HgCl2 (aq) + SnCl2 (aq) → Hg2Cl2 (s)+SnCl4 (aq)
(7.11)
(addition of mercury to mercuric chloride)
In reaction (7.11) simultaneous oxidation
of stannous chloride to stannic chloride is
also occurring because of the addition of
electronegative element chlorine to it. It was
soon realised that oxidation and reduction
always occur simultaneously (as will be
apparent by re-examining all the equations
given above), hence, the word “redox” was
coined for this class of chemical reactions.
Problem 7.1
In the reactions given below, identify
the species undergoing oxidation and
reduction:
(i) H2S (g) + Cl2 (g) → 2 HCl (g) + S (s)
(ii) 3Fe3O4 (s) + 8 Al (s) → 9 Fe (s)
+ 4Al2O3 (s)
(iii) 2 Na (s) + H2 (g) → 2 NaH (s)
Solution
(i) H 2 S is oxidised because a more
electronegative element, chlorine is added
to hydrogen (or a more electropositive
element, hydrogen has been removed
from S). Chlorine is reduced due to
addition of hydrogen to it.
(ii) Aluminium is oxidised because
oxygen is added to it. Ferrous ferric oxide

(Fe3O4) is reduced because oxygen has
been removed from it.
(iii) With the careful application of the
concept of electronegativity only we
may infer that sodium is oxidised and
hydrogen is reduced.
Reaction (iii) chosen here prompts us to
think in terms of another way to define
redox reactions.
7.2 REDOX REACTIONS IN TERMS OF
ELECTRON TRANSFER REACTIONS
We have already learnt that the reactions
(7.12)
2Na(s) + Cl2(g) → 2NaCl (s)
(7.13)
4Na(s) + O2(g) → 2Na2O(s)
(7.14)
2Na(s) + S(s)
→ Na2S(s)
are redox reactions because in each of these
reactions sodium is oxidised due to the addition
of either oxygen or more electronegative
element to sodium. Simultaneously, chlorine,
oxygen and sulphur are reduced because to
each of these, the electropositive element
sodium has been added. From our knowledge
of chemical bonding we also know that sodium
chloride, sodium oxide and sodium sulphide
are ionic compounds and perhaps better
written as Na+Cl– (s), (Na+)2O2–(s), and (Na+)2
S2–(s). Development of charges on the species
produced suggests us to rewrite the reactions
(7.12 to 7.14) in the following manner :

For convenience, each of the above
processes can be considered as two separate
steps, one involving the loss of electrons
and the other the gain of electrons. As an
illustration, we may further elaborate one of
these, say, the formation of sodium chloride.
2 Na(s) → 2 Na+(g) + 2e–
Cl2(g) + 2e– → 2 Cl–(g)
Each of the above steps is called a half
reaction, which explicitly shows involvement
of electrons. Sum of the half reactions gives
the overall reaction :
2 Na(s) + Cl2 (g) → 2 Na+ Cl– (s) or 2 NaCl (s)
Reactions 7.12 to 7.14 suggest that half
reactions that involve loss of electrons are
called oxidation reactions. Similarly, the
half reactions that involve gain of electrons
are called reduction reactions. It may not
be out of context to mention here that the
new way of defining oxidation and reduction
has been achieved only by establishing a
correlation between the behaviour of species
as per the classical idea and their interplay
in electron-transfer change. In reactions (7.12
to 7.14) sodium, which is oxidised, acts as
a reducing agent because it donates electron
to each of the elements interacting with it and
thus helps in reducing them. Chlorine, oxygen
and sulphur are reduced and act as oxidising
agents because these accept electrons from
sodium. To summarise, we may mention that
Oxidation : Loss of electron(s) by any species.
Reduction : Gain of electron(s) by any species.
Oxidising agent : Acceptor of electron(s).
Reducing agent : Donor of electron(s).
Problem 7.2 Justify that the reaction:
2 Na(s) + H2(g) → 2 NaH (s) is a redox
change.
Solution
Since in the above reaction the compound
formed is an ionic compound, which may
also be represented as Na+H– (s), this
suggests that one half reaction in this
process is :
→ 2 Na+(g) + 2e–
2 Na (s)

chemistry

and the other half reaction is:
H2 (g) + 2e– → 2 H–(g)
This splitting of the reaction under
examination into two half reactions
automatically reveals that here sodium
is oxidised and hydrogen is reduced,
therefore, the complete reaction is a
redox change.
7.2.1 Competitive Electron T ransfer
Reactions
Place a strip of metallic zinc in an aqueous
solution of copper nitrate as shown in Fig.
7.1, for about one hour. You may notice
that the strip becomes coated with reddish
metallic copper and the blue colour of the
solution disappears. Formation of Zn2+ ions
among the products can easily be judged
when the blue colour of the solution due to
Cu2+ has disappeared. If hydrogen sulphide
gas is passed through the colourless solution
containing Zn2+ ions, appearance of white zinc
sulphide, ZnS can be seen on making the
solution alkaline with ammonia.
The reaction between metallic zinc and the
aqueous solution of copper nitrate is :
(7.15)
Zn(s) + Cu2+ (aq) → Zn2+ (aq) + Cu(s)
In reaction (7.15), zinc has lost electrons
to form Zn2+ and, therefore, zinc is oxidised.
Evidently, now if zinc is oxidised, releasing
electrons, something must be reduced,
accepting the electrons lost by zinc. Copper
ion is reduced by gaining electrons from the zinc.
Reaction (7.15) may be rewritten as :

At this stage we may investigate the state
of equilibrium for the reaction represented by
equation (7.15). For this purpose, let us place
a strip of metallic copper in a zinc sulphate
solution. No visible reaction is noticed and
attempt to detect the presence of Cu2+ ions
by passing H2S gas through the solution to
produce the black colour of cupric sulphide,
CuS, does not succeed. Cupric sulphide has
such a low solubility that this is an extremely
sensitive test; yet the amount of Cu2+ formed
cannot be detected. We thus conclude that
the state of equilibrium for the reaction (7.15)
greatly favours the products over the reactants.
Let us extend electron transfer reaction
now to copper metal and silver nitrate solution
in water and arrange a set-up as shown in
Fig. 7.2. The solution develops blue colour
due to the formation of Cu2+ ions on account
of the reaction:

(7.16)
Here, Cu(s) is oxidised to Cu 2+ (aq) and
Ag+(aq) is reduced to Ag(s). Equilibrium greatly
favours the products Cu2+ (aq) and Ag(s).
By way of contrast, let us also compare
the reaction of metallic cobalt placed in nickel
sulphate solution. The reaction that occurs
here is :

Fig. 7.2 Redox reaction between copper and aqueous solution of silver nitrate occurring in a beaker.

At equilibrium, chemical tests reveal that both
Ni2+(aq) and Co2+(aq) are present at moderate
concentrations. In this case, neither the
reactants [Co(s) and Ni2+(aq)] nor the products
[Co2+(aq) and Ni (s)] are greatly favoured.
This competition for release of electrons
incidently reminds us of the competition for
release of protons among acids. The similarity
suggests that we might develop a table in
which metals and their ions are listed on the
basis of their tendency to release electrons
just as we do in the case of acids to indicate
the strength of the acids. As a matter of fact
we have already made certain comparisons.
By comparison we have come to know that
zinc releases electrons to copper and copper
releases electrons to silver and, therefore,
the electron releasing tendency of the metals
is in the order: Zn>Cu>Ag. We would love to
make our list more vast and design a metal
activity series or electrochemical series.
The competition for electrons between various
metals helps us to design a class of cells,
named as Galvanic cells in which the chemical
reactions become the source of electrical
energy. We would study more about these
cells in Class XII.
7.3 OXIDATION NUMBER
A less obvious example of electron transfer is
realised when hydrogen combines with oxygen
to form water by the reaction:
(7.18)
2H2(g) + O2 (g) → 2H2O (l)
Though not simple in its approach, yet
we can visualise the H atom as going from a
neutral (zero) state in H2 to a positive state in
H2O, the O atom goes from a zero state in O2
to a dinegative state in H2O. It is assumed that
there is an electron transfer from H to O and
consequently H2 is oxidised and O2 is reduced.

However, as we shall see later, the charge
transfer is only partial and is perhaps better
described as an electron shift rather than a
complete loss of electron by H and gain by
O. What has been said here with respect
to equation (7.18) may be true for a good
number of other reactions involving covalent
compounds. Two such examples of this class
of the reactions are:
(7.19)
H2(s) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)		
and,
CH 4(g) + 4Cl2(g) → CCl4(l) + 4HCl(g) (7.20)
In order to keep track of electron shifts
in chemical reactions involving formation
of covalent compounds, a more practical
method of using oxidation number has
been developed. In this method, it is always
assumed that there is a complete transfer
of electron from a less electronegative atom
to a more electonegative atom. For example,
we rewrite equations (7.18 to 7.20) to show
charge on each of the atoms forming part of
the reaction :
0

0

+1 –2

2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O (l)
0

H2 (s) + Cl2(g) → 2HCl(g)

+1 –1

0

+4 –1

(7.22)
+1 –1

CH4(g) + 4Cl2(g) → CCl4(l) +4HCl(g) (7.23)
It may be emphasised that the assumption
of electron transfer is made for book-keeping
purpose only and it will become obvious at
a later stage in this unit that it leads to the
simple description of redox reactions.
Oxidation number denotes the oxidation
state of an element in a compound
ascertained according to a set of rules
formulated on the basis that electron pair

chemistry

in a covalent bond belongs entirely to more
electronegative element.
It is not always possible to remember or
make out easily in a compound/ion, which
element is more electronegative than the
other. Therefore, a set of rules has been
formulated to determine the oxidation
number of an element in a compound/ion.
If two or more than two atoms of an element
are present in the molecule/ion such as
Na2S2O3/Cr2O72–, the oxidation number of the
atom of that element will then be the average
of the oxidation number of all the atoms of
that element. We may at this stage, state the
rules for the calculation of oxidation number.
These rules are:
1. In elements, in the free or the uncombined
state, each atom bears an oxidation
number of zero. Evidently each atom in
H2, O2, Cl2, O3, P4, S8, Na, Mg, Al has the
oxidation number zero.
2. For ions composed of only one atom, the
oxidation number is equal to the charge
on the ion. Thus Na+ ion has an oxidation
number of +1, Mg2+ ion, +2, Fe3+ ion, +3,
Cl– ion, –1, O2– ion, –2; and so on. In their
compounds all alkali metals have oxidation
number of +1, and all alkaline earth metals
have an oxidation number of +2. Aluminium
is regarded to have an oxidation number of
+3 in all its compounds.
3. The oxidation number of oxygen in most
compounds is –2. However, we come
across two kinds of exceptions here.
One arises in the case of peroxides and
superoxides, the compounds of oxygen in
which oxygen atoms are directly linked to
each other. While in peroxides (e.g., H2O2,
Na2O2), each oxygen atom is assigned an
oxidation number of –1, in superoxides
(e.g., KO2, RbO2) each oxygen atom is
assigned an oxidation number of –(½).
The second exception appears rarely, i.e.
when oxygen is bonded to fluorine. In
such compounds e.g., oxygen difluoride
(OF2) and dioxygen difluoride (O2F2), the
oxygen is assigned an oxidation number
of +2 and +1, respectively. The number
assigned to oxygen will depend upon the

bonding state of oxygen but this number
would now be a positive figure only.
4. The oxidation number of hydrogen is +1,
except when it is bonded to metals in binary
compounds (that is compounds containing
two elements). For example, in LiH, NaH,
and CaH2, its oxidation number is –1.
5. In all its compounds, fluorine has an
oxidation number of –1. Other halogens (Cl,
Br, and I) also have an oxidation number
of –1, when they occur as halide ions in
their compounds. Chlorine, bromine and
iodine when combined with oxygen, for
example in oxoacids and oxoanions, have
positive oxidation numbers.
6. The algebraic sum of the oxidation number
of all the atoms in a compound must be
zero. In polyatomic ion, the algebraic sum
of all the oxidation numbers of atoms of
the ion must equal the charge on the ion.
Thus, the sum of oxidation number of three
oxygen atoms and one carbon atom in the
carbonate ion, (CO3)2– must equal –2.
By the application of above rules, we can
find out the oxidation number of the desired
element in a molecule or in an ion. It is clear
that the metallic elements have positive
oxidation number and nonmetallic elements
have positive or negative oxidation number.
The atoms of transition elements usually
display several positive oxidation states. The
highest oxidation number of a representative
element is the group number for the first
two groups and the group number minus 10
(following the long form of periodic table) for
the other groups. Thus, it implies that the
highest value of oxidation number exhibited
by an atom of an element generally increases
across the period in the periodic table. In the
third period, the highest value of oxidation
number changes from 1 to 7 as indicated
below in the compounds of the elements.
A term that is often used interchangeably
with the oxidation number is the oxidation
state. Thus in CO2, the oxidation state of
carbon is +4, that is also its oxidation number
and similarly the oxidation state as well
as oxidation number of oxygen is – 2. This
implies that the oxidation number denotes the
oxidation state of an element in a compound.

The oxidation number/state of a metal in a
compound is sometimes presented according
to the notation given by German chemist,
Alfred Stock. It is popularly known as Stock
notation. According to this, the oxidation
number is expressed by putting a Roman
numeral representing the oxidation number
in parenthesis after the symbol of the metal in
the molecular formula. Thus aurous chloride
and auric chloride are written as Au(I)Cl and
Au(III)Cl3. Similarly, stannous chloride and
stannic chloride are written as Sn(II)Cl2 and
Sn(IV)Cl4. This change in oxidation number
implies change in oxidation state, which in
turn helps to identify whether the species
is present in oxidised form or reduced form.
Thus, Hg2(I)Cl2 is the reduced form of Hg(II) Cl2.
Problem 7.3
Using Stock notation, represent the
following compounds :HAuCl4, Tl2O, FeO,
Fe2O3, CuI, CuO, MnO and MnO2.
Solution
By applying various rules of calculating
the oxidation number of the desired
element in a compound, the oxidation
number of each metallic element in its
compound is as follows:
→
Au has 3
HAuCl4
Tl2O
→
Tl has 1
FeO
→
Fe has 2
Fe2O3
→
Fe has 3
CuI
→
Cu has 1
→
Cu has 2
CuO
→
Mn has 2
MnO
MnO2
→
Mn has 4
Therefore, these compounds may be
represented as:
HAu(III)Cl4, Tl2(I)O, Fe(II)O, Fe 2(III)O3,
Cu(I)I, Cu(II)O, Mn(II)O, Mn(IV)O2.

The idea of oxidation number has been
invariably applied to define oxidation,
reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant), reducing
agent (reductant) and the redox reaction. To
summarise, we may say that:
Oxidation: An increase in the oxidation
number of the element in the given substance.
Reduction
: A decrease in the oxidation
number of the element in the given substance.
Oxidising agent: A reagent which can
increase the oxidation number of an element
in a given substance. These reagents are
called as oxidants also.
Reducing agent: A reagent which lowers the
oxidation number of an element in a given
substance. These reagents are also called as
reductants.
Redox reactions: Reactions which involve
change in oxidation number of the interacting
species.
Problem 7.4
Justify that the reaction:
2Cu2O(s) + Cu2S(s) → 6Cu(s) + SO2(g)
is a redox reaction. Identify the species
oxidised/reduced, which acts as an
oxidant and which acts as a reductant.
Solution
Let us assign oxidation number to each
of the species in the reaction under
examination. This results into:
+1 –2

+1 –2

0

+4 –2

2Cu2O(s) + Cu2S(s) → 6Cu(s) + SO2
We therefore, conclude that in this
reaction copper is reduced from +1 state
to zero oxidation state and sulphur is
oxidised from –2 state to +4 state. The
above reaction is thus a redox reaction.

chemistry

Further, Cu2O helps sulphur in Cu2S to
increase its oxidation number, therefore,
Cu(I) is an oxidant; and sulphur of Cu2S
helps copper both in Cu2S itself and
Cu2O to decrease its oxidation number;
therefore, sulphur of Cu2S is reductant.
7.3.1 Types of Redox Reactions
1. Combination reactions
A combination reaction may be denoted in
the manner:
A+B → C
Either A and B or both A and B must be in
the elemental form for such a reaction to be
a redox reaction. All combustion reactions,
which make use of elemental dioxygen, as well
as other reactions involving elements other
than dioxygen, are redox reactions. Some
important examples of this category are:
0

+4 –2

C(s) + O2 (g)

2. Decomposition reactions
Decomposition reactions are the opposite
of combination reactions. Precisely, a
decomposition reaction leads to the breakdown
of a compound into two or more components
at least one of which must be in the elemental
state. Examples of this class of reactions are:
+1 –2		

0

2H2 (g) + O2(g)

+1 –1

2NaH (s)

2Na (s) + H2(g)

0

(7.27)

0

2KClO3 (s)
2KCl (s) + 3O2(g)
(7.28)
It may carefully be noted that there is no
change in the oxidation number of hydrogen
in methane under combination reactions
and that of potassium in potassium chlorate
in reaction (7.28). This may also be noted

+2 –2

+4 –2

CaCO3 (s)
CaO(s) + CO2(g)
3. Displacement reactions
In a displacement reaction, an ion (or an
atom) in a compound is replaced by an ion
(or an atom) of another element. It may be
denoted as:
X + YZ → XZ + Y
Displacement reactions fit into two
categories: metal displacement and non-metal
displacement.
(a) Metal displacement: A metal in a
compound can be displaced by another metal
in the uncombined state. We have already
discussed about this class of the reactions
under section 7.2.1. Metal displacement
reactions find many applications in
metallurgical processes in which pure metals
are obtained from their compounds in ores. A
few such examples are:

here that all decomposition reactions are not
redox reactions. For example, decomposition
of calcium carbonate is not a redox reaction.

0

+3 –2

0

Cr2O3 (s) + 2 Al (s)
Al2O3 (s) + 2Cr(s)		
					
(7.32)
In each case, the reducing metal is a
better reducing agent than the one that is
being reduced which evidently shows more
capability to lose electrons as compared to
the one that is reduced.
(b) Non-metal displacement: The nonmetal displacement redox reactions include
hydrogen displacement and a rarely occurring
reaction involving oxygen displacement.

Many metals, including those which do not
react with cold water, are capable of displacing
hydrogen from acids. Dihydrogen from acids
may even be produced by such metals which
do not react with steam. Cadmium and tin are
the examples of such metals. A few examples
for the displacement of hydrogen from acids
are:

Cu>Ag. Like metals, activity series also exists
for the halogens. The power of these elements
as oxidising agents decreases as we move
down from fluorine to iodine in group 17 of the
periodic table. This implies that fluorine is so
reactive that it can replace chloride, bromide
and iodide ions in solution. In fact, fluorine is
so reactive that it attacks water and displaces
the oxygen of water :

2H2O (l) + 2F2 (g) → 4HF(aq) + O2(g) (7.40)
It is for this reason that the displacement
reactions of chlorine, bromine and iodine
using fluorine are not generally carried out in
aqueous solution. On the other hand, chlorine
can displace bromide and iodide ions in an
aqueous solution as shown below:
Cl2 (g) + 2KBr (aq) → 2 KCl (aq) + Br2 (l)
					
(7.41)
Cl2 (g) + 2KI (aq) → 2 KCl (aq) + I2 (s)
(7.42)
					
As Br2 and I2 are coloured and dissolve in CCl4,
can easily be identified from the colour of the
solution. The above reactions can be written
in ionic form as:

Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) → ZnCl2 (aq) + H2 (g)
					
(7.37)

Cl2 (g) + 2Br (aq) → 2Cl (aq) + Br2 (l) (7.41a)

(7.39)
					
Reactions (7.37 to 7.39) are used to
prepare dihydrogen gas in the laboratory.
Here, the reactivity of metals is reflected in
the rate of hydrogen gas evolution, which is
the slowest for the least active metal Fe, and
the fastest for the most reactive metal, Mg.
Very less active metals, which may occur in
the native state such as silver (Ag), and gold
(Au) do not react even with hydrochloric acid.
In section (7.2.1) we have already discussed
that the metals – zinc (Zn), copper (Cu) and
silver (Ag) through tendency to lose electrons
show their reducing activity in the order Zn>

Reactions (7.41) and (7.42) form the basis
of identifying Br– and I– in the laboratory
through the test popularly known as ‘Layer
Test’. It may not be out of place to mention
here that bromine likewise can displace iodide
ion in solution:

The halogen displacement reactions have
a direct industrial application. The recovery
of halogens from their halides requires an
oxidation process, which is represented by:
2X–

→ X2 + 2e–			

(7.44)

here X denotes a halogen element. Whereas
chemical means are available to oxidise Cl–,
Br– and I–, as fluorine is the strongest oxidising

agent; there is no way to convert F– ions to F2
by chemical means. The only way to achieve
F2 from F– is to oxidise electrolytically, the
details of which you will study at a later stage.
4. Disproportionation reactions
Disproportionation reactions are a special type
of redox reactions. In a disproportionation
reaction an element in one oxidation state
is simultaneously oxidised and reduced.
One of the r eacting substances in a
disproportionation reaction always contains
an element that can exist in at least three
oxidation states. The element in the form
of reacting substance is in the intermediate
oxidation state; and both higher and lower
oxidation states of that element are formed in
the reaction. The decomposition of hydrogen
peroxide is a familiar example of the reaction,
where oxygen experiences disproportionation.
+1 –1

2H2O2 (aq) → 2H2O(l) + O2(g)

Here the oxygen of peroxide, which is present
in –1 state, is converted to zero oxidation state
in O2 and decreases to –2 oxidation state in
H2O.
Phosphorous, sulphur and chlorine
undergo disproportionation in the alkaline
medium as shown below :

(7.48)
The reaction (7.48) describes the
formation of household bleaching agents.
The hypochlorite ion (ClO –) formed in the
reaction oxidises the colour-bearing stains
of the substances to colourless compounds.
It is of interest to mention here that whereas
bromine and iodine follow the same trend
as exhibited by chlorine in reaction (7.48),

fluorine shows deviation from this behaviour
when it reacts with alkali. The reaction that
takes place in the case of fluorine is as follows:
2 F2(g) + 2OH–(aq) → 2 F–(aq) + OF2(g) + H2O(l)
(7.49)
(It is to be noted with care that fluorine in
reaction (7.49) will undoubtedly attack water
to produce some oxygen also). This departure
shown by fluorine is not surprising for us as
we know the limitation of fluorine that, being
the most electronegative element, it cannot
exhibit any positive oxidation state. This
means that among halogens, fluorine does not
show a disproportionation tendency.
Problem 7.5
Which of the following species, do not
show disproportionation reaction and
why ?
ClO–, ClO2–, ClO3– and ClO4–
Also write reaction for each of the species
that disproportionates.
Solution
Among the oxoanions of chlorine listed
above, ClO4– does not disproportionate
because in this oxoanion chlorine is
present in its highest oxidation state that
is, +7. The disproportionation reactions
for the other three oxoanions of chlorine
are as follows:

Solution
In reaction (a), the compound nitric
oxide is formed by the combination of
the elemental substances, nitrogen and
oxygen; therefore, this is an example
of combination redox reactions. The
reaction (b) involves the breaking down
of lead nitrate into three components;
therefore, this is categorised under
decomposition redox reaction. In

reaction (c), hydrogen of water has been
displaced by hydride ion into dihydrogen
gas. Therefore, this may be called as
displacement redox reaction. The reaction
(d) involves disproportionation of NO2
(+4 state) into NO2– (+3 state) and NO3–
(+5 state). Therefore reaction (d) is an
example of disproportionation redox
reaction.

The Paradox of Fractional Oxidation Number
Sometimes, we come across with certain compounds in which the oxidation number of a particular
element in the compound is in fraction. Examples are:
C3O2 [where oxidation number of carbon is (4/3)],
Br3O8 [where oxidation number of bromine is (16/3)]
and Na2S4O6 (where oxidation number of sulphur is 2.5).
We know that the idea of fractional oxidation number is unconvincing to us, because electrons
are never shared/transferred in fraction. Actually this fractional oxidation state is the average
oxidation state of the element under examination and the structural parameters reveal that the
element for whom fractional oxidation state is realised is present in different oxidation states.
Structure of the species C3O2, Br3O8 and S4O62– reveal the following bonding situations:

+2

O = C = C*= C = O
Structure of C3O2
(carbon suboxide)

Structure of Br3O8 (tribromooctaoxide)			

Structure of S4O62– (tetrathionate ion)

The element marked with asterisk in each species is exhibiting the different oxidation
state (oxidation number) from rest of the atoms of the same element in each of the species.
This reveals that in C3O2, two carbon atoms are present in +2 oxidation state each, whereas
the third one is present in zero oxidation state and the average is 4/3. However, the realistic
picture is +2 for two terminal carbons and zero for the middle carbon. Likewise in Br3O8, each
of the two terminal bromine atoms are present in +6 oxidation state and the middle bromine
is present in +4 oxidation state. Once again the average, that is different from reality, is
16/3. In the same fashion, in the species S4O62–, each of the two extreme sulphurs exhibits oxidation
state of +5 and the two middle sulphurs as zero. The average of four oxidation numbers of sulphurs
of the S4O62– is 2.5, whereas the reality being + 5,0,0 and +5 oxidation number respectively for
each sulphur.
We may thus, in general, conclude that the idea of fractional oxidation state should be taken
with care and the reality is revealed by the structures only. Further, whenever we come across
with fractional oxidation state of any particular element in any species, we must understand that
this is the average oxidation number only. In reality (revealed by structures only), the element in
that particular species is present in more than one whole number oxidation states. Fe3O4, Mn3O4,
Pb3O4 are some of the other examples of the compounds, which are mixed oxides, where we come
across with fractional oxidation states of the metal atom. However, the oxidation states may be in
fraction as in O2+ and O2– where it is +½ and –½ respectively.

Problem 7.7
Why do the following reactions proceed
differently ?
Pb3O4 + 8HCl → 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O and
Pb3O4 + 4HNO3 → 2Pb(NO3)2 + PbO2 + 		
2H2O
Solution
Pb 3 O 4 is actually a stoichiometric
mixture of 2 mol of PbO and 1 mol of
PbO2. In PbO 2, lead is present in +4
oxidation state, whereas the stable
oxidation state of lead in PbO is +2. PbO2
thus can act as an oxidant (oxidising
agent) and, therefore, can oxidise Cl– ion
of HCl into chlorine. We may also keep in
mind that PbO is a basic oxide. Therefore,
the reaction
Pb3O4 + 8HCl → 3PbCl2 + Cl2 + 4H2O
can be splitted into two reactions namely:
2PbO + 4HCl → 2PbCl2 + 2H2O
(acid-base reaction)
+4

PbO2 + 4HCl → PbCl2 + Cl2 +2H2O
(redox reaction)
Since HNO3 itself is an oxidising agent
therefore, it is unlikely that the reaction
may occur between PbO 2 and HNO 3.
However, the acid-base reaction occurs
between PbO and HNO3 as:
2PbO + 4HNO3 → 2Pb(NO3)2 + 2H2O
It is the passive nature of PbO2 against
HNO3 that makes the reaction different
from the one that follows with HCl.
7.3.2 Balancing of Redox Reactions
Two methods are used to balance chemical
equations for redox processes. One of these
methods is based on the change in the
oxidation number of reducing agent and the
oxidising agent and the other method is based
on splitting the redox reaction into two half
reactions — one involving oxidation and the
other involving reduction. Both these methods
are in use and the choice of their use rests
with the individual using them.

(a) Oxidation Number Method: In writing
equations for oxidation-reduction reactions,
just as for other reactions, the compositions and
formulas must be known for the substances
that react and for the products that are
formed. The oxidation number method is now
best illustrated in the following steps:
Step 1: Write the correct formula for each
reactant and product.
Step 2: Identify atoms which undergo
change in oxidation number in the reaction
by assigning the oxidation number to all
elements in the reaction.
Step 3: Calculate the increase or decrease
in the oxidation number per atom and for
the entire molecule/ion in which it occurs. If
these are not equal then multiply by suitable
number so that these become equal. (If you
realise that two substances are reduced and
nothing is oxidised or vice-versa, something
is wrong. Either the formulas of reactants or
products are wrong or the oxidation numbers
have not been assigned properly).
Step 4: Ascertain the involvement of ions if
the reaction is taking place in water, add H+ or
OH– ions to the expression on the appropriate
side so that the total ionic charges of reactants
and products are equal. If the reaction is
carried out in acidic solution, use H+ ions in
the equation; if in basic solution, use OH– ions.
Step 5 : Make the numbers of hydrogen
atoms in the expression on the two sides
equal by adding water (H2O) molecules to the
reactants or products. Now, also check the
number of oxygen atoms. If there are the same
number of oxygen atoms in the reactants and
products, the equation then represents the
balanced redox reaction.
Let us now explain the steps involved in
the method with the help of a few problems
given below:
Problem 7.8
Write the net ionic equation for the
reaction of potassium dichromate(VI),
K2Cr2O7 with sodium sulphite, Na2SO3,
in an acid solution to give chromium(III)
ion and the sulphate ion.

247

Solution
Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is:
Cr2O72–(aq) + SO32–(aq) → Cr3+(aq)
+ SO42–(aq)
Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for
Cr and S
+6 –2

+4 –2

+3

+6 –2

Cr2O72–(aq) + SO32–(aq) → Cr(aq)+SO42–(aq)
This indicates that the dichromate ion is
the oxidant and the sulphite ion is the
reductant.
Step 3: Calculate the increase and
decrease of oxidation number, and make
them equal: from step-2 we can notice
that there is change in oxidation state
of chromium and sulphur. Oxidation
state of chromium changes form +6 to
+3. There is decrease of +3 in oxidation
state of chromium on right hand side of
the equation. Oxidation state of sulphur
changes from +4 to +6. There is an increase
of +2 in the oxidation state of sulphur on
right hand side. To make the increase and
decrease of oxidation state equal, place
numeral 2 before cromium ion on right
hand side and numeral 3 before sulphate
ion on right hand side and balance the
chromium and sulphur atoms on both the
sides of the equation. Thus we get
+6 –2

+4 –2

+3

Cr2O72–(aq) + 3SO32– (aq) → 2Cr3+ (aq) +
					

+6 –2

3SO42– (aq)
Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the
acidic medium, and further the ionic
charges are not equal on both the sides,
add 8H+ on the left to make ionic charges
equal
Cr2O72–(aq) + 3SO32–(aq)+ 8H+→ 2Cr3+(aq)
+ 3SO42– (aq)
Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen
atoms, and add appropriate number of
water molecules (i.e., 4H2O) on the right
to achieve balanced redox change.
Cr2O72– (aq) + 3SO32– (aq)+ 8H+ (aq) →
2Cr3+ (aq) + 3SO42– (aq) +4H2O (l)

Problem 7.9
Permanganate ion reacts with bromide
ion in basic medium to give manganese
dioxide and bromate ion. Write the
balanced ionic equation for the reaction.
Solution
Step 1: The skeletal ionic equation is :
MnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) → MnO2(s) + BrO3– (aq)
Step 2: Assign oxidation numbers for
Mn and Br
+7

–1

+5

MnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) →MnO2 (s) + BrO3– (aq)
this indicates that permanganate ion
is the oxidant and bromide ion is the
reductant.
Step 3: Calculate the increase and
decrease of oxidation number, and make
the increase equal to the decrease.
+7

–1

2MnO (aq)+Br (aq) → 2MnO2(s)+BrO3–(aq)
Step 4: As the reaction occurs in the
basic medium, and the ionic charges are
not equal on both sides, add 2 OH– ions
on the right to make ionic charges equal.
2MnO4– (aq) + Br– (aq) → 2MnO2(s) +
BrO3–(aq) + 2OH–(aq)
Step 5: Finally, count the hydrogen atoms
and add appropriate number of water
molecules (i.e. one H2O molecule) on the
left side to achieve balanced redox change.
2MnO4–(aq) + Br–(aq) + H2O(l) → 2MnO2(s)
		
+ BrO3– (aq) + 2OH–(aq)

(b) Half Reaction Method: In this method,
the two half equations are balanced separately
and then added together to give balanced
equation.
Suppose we are to balance the equation
showing the oxidation of Fe2+ ions to Fe3+ ions
by dichromate ions (Cr2O7)2– in acidic medium,
wherein, Cr2O72– ions are reduced to Cr3+ ions.
The following steps are involved in this task.
Step 1: Produce unbalanced equation for the
reaction in ionic form :
Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O72– (aq) → Fe3+ (aq) + Cr3+(aq)
(7.50)

chemistry

Step 2: Separate the equation into halfreactions:
			 +2
+3
Oxidation half : Fe2+ (aq) → Fe3+(aq)
(7.51)
+3
			 +6 –2		
Reduction half : Cr2O72–(aq) → Cr3+(aq)		
(7.52)
Step 3: Balance the atoms other than O and
H in each half reaction individually. Here the
oxidation half reaction is already balanced
with respect to Fe atoms. For the reduction
half reaction, we multiply the Cr3+ by 2 to
balance Cr atoms.
Cr2O72–(aq) → 2 Cr3+(aq)

(7.53)

Step 4: For reactions occurring in acidic
medium, add H2O to balance O atoms and H+
to balance H atoms.
Thus, we get :
Cr2O72– (aq) + 14H+ (aq) → 2 Cr3+(aq) + 7H2O (l)
(7.54)
Step 5: Add electrons to one side of the half
reaction to balance the charges. If need be,
make the number of electrons equal in the
two half reactions by multiplying one or both
half reactions by appropriate number.
The oxidation half reaction is thus
rewritten to balance the charge:
Fe2+ (aq) → Fe3+ (aq) + e–

(7.55)

Now in the reduction half reaction there
are net twelve positive charges on the left hand
side and only six positive charges on the right
hand side. Therefore, we add six electrons on
the left side.
Cr2O72– (aq) + 14H+ (aq) + 6e– → 2Cr3+(aq) +
7H2O (l) (7.56)
To equalise the number of electrons in both
the half reactions, we multiply the oxidation
half reaction by 6 and write as :
6Fe2+ (aq) → 6Fe3+(aq) + 6e–		

(7.57)

Step 6: We add the two half reactions to
achieve the overall reaction and cancel the
electrons on each side. This gives the net ionic
equation as :
6Fe2+(aq) + Cr2O72–(aq) + 14H+(aq) → 6 Fe3+(aq) +
2Cr 3+(aq) + 7H2O(l) (7.58)

Step 7: Verify that the equation contains the
same type and number of atoms and the same
charges on both sides of the equation. This
last check reveals that the equation is fully
balanced with respect to number of atoms
and the charges.
For the reaction in a basic medium, first
balance the atoms as is done in acidic medium.
Then for each H+ ion, add an equal number of
OH– ions to both sides of the equation. Where
H+ and OH– appear on the same side of the
equation, combine these to give H2O.
Problem 7.10
Permanganate(VII) ion, MnO4– in basic
solution oxidises iodide ion, I– to produce
molecular iodine (I2) and manganese
(IV) oxide (MnO2). Write a balanced ionic
equation to represent this redox reaction.
Solution
First we write the skeletal
Step 1:
ionic equation, which is
MnO4– (aq) + I– (aq) → MnO2(s) + I2(s)
Step 2: The two half-reactions are:
–1
0
		
Oxidation half : I–(aq) → I2 (s)
		
+7		
+4
Reduction half: MnO4–(aq) → MnO2(s)
Step 3: To balance the I atoms in the
oxidation half reaction, we rewrite it as:
		2I– (aq) → I2 (s)
Step 4: To balance the O atoms in the
reduction half reaction, we add two water
molecules on the right:
MnO4– (aq) → MnO2 (s) + 2 H2O (l)
To balance the H atoms, we add four H+
ions on the left:
MnO–4 (aq) + 4 H+ (aq) → MnO2(s) + 2H2O (l)
As the reaction takes place in a basic
solution, therefore, for four H+ ions, we
add four OH– ions to both sides of the
equation:
MnO–4 (aq) + 4H+ (aq) + 4OH–(aq) →
MnO2 (s) + 2 H2O(l) + 4OH– (aq)
Replacing the H+ and OH– ions with water,

redox reactions

249

the resultant equation is:
MnO4– (aq) + 2H2O (l) → MnO2 (s) + 4 OH– (aq)
Step 5 : In this step we balance the
charges of the two half-reactions in the
manner depicted as:
2I– (aq) → I2 (s) + 2e–
MnO4–(aq) + 2H2O(l) + 3e– → MnO2(s)
+ 4OH–(aq)
Now to equalise the number of electrons,
we multiply the oxidation half-reaction by
3 and the reduction half-reaction by 2.
6I–(aq) → 3I2 (s) + 6e–
2 MnO4– (aq) + 4H2O (l) +6e– → 2MnO2(s)
+ 8OH– (aq)
Step 6: Add two half-reactions to
obtain the net reactions after cancelling
electrons on both sides.
6I –(aq) + 2MnO4–(aq) + 4H2O(l) → 3I2(s) +
2MnO2(s) +8 OH–(aq)
Step 7: A final verification shows that
the equation is balanced in respect of
the number of atoms and charges on
both sides.
7.3.3 Redox Reactions as the Basis for
Titrations
In acid-base systems we come across with a
titration method for finding out the strength
of one solution against the other using a
pH sensitive indicator. Similarly, in redox
systems, the titration method can be adopted
to determine the strength of a reductant/
oxidant using a redox sensitive indicator.
The usage of indicators in redox titration is
illustrated below:
(i) In one situation, the reagent itself is
intensely coloured, e.g., permanganate
ion, MnO4–. Here MnO4– acts as the self
indicator. The visible end point in this case
is achieved after the last of the reductant
(Fe2+ or C2O42–) is oxidised and the first
lasting tinge of pink colour appears at
MnO4– concentration as low as 10–6 mol dm–3
(10–6 mol L–1). This ensures a minimal
‘overshoot’ in colour beyond the equivalence
point, the point where the reductant and
the oxidant are equal in terms of their
mole stoichiometry.

(ii) If there is no dramatic auto-colour change
(as with MnO4– titration), there are indicators
which are oxidised immediately after the
last bit of the reactant is consumed,
producing a dramatic colour change. The
best example is afforded by Cr2O72–, which
is not a self-indicator, but oxidises the
indicator substance diphenylamine just
after the equivalence point to produce an
intense blue colour, thus signalling the
end point.
(iii) There is yet another method which is
interesting and quite common. Its use is
restricted to those reagents which are able
to oxidise I– ions, say, for example, Cu(II):
2Cu2+(aq) + 4I–(aq) → Cu2I2(s) + I2(aq) (7.59)
This method relies on the facts that
iodine itself gives an intense blue colour with
starch and has a very specific reaction with
thiosulphate ions (S2O32–), which too is a redox
reaction:
(aq)→2I–(aq) + S4O62–(aq) (7.60)
I2(aq) + 2 S2O2–
3
I2, though insoluble in water, remains in
solution containing KI as KI3.
On addition of starch after the liberation
of iodine from the reaction of Cu2+ ions on
iodide ions, an intense blue colour appears.
This colour disappears as soon as the iodine
is consumed by the thiosulphate ions. Thus,
the end-point can easily be tracked and the
rest is the stoichiometric calculation only.
7.3.4 Limitations of Concept of Oxidation
Number
As you have observed in the above discussion,
the concept of redox processes has been
evolving with time. This process of evolution
is continuing. In fact, in recent past the
oxidation process is visualised as a decrease
in electron density and reduction process as
an increase in electron density around the
atom(s) involved in the reaction.
7.4 Redox Reactions and Electrode
Processes
The experiment corresponding to reaction
(7.15), can also be observed if zinc rod is
dipped in copper sulphate solution. The
redox reaction takes place and during the



Unit 7.indd 249

250

chemistry

reaction, zinc is oxidised to zinc ions and
copper ions are reduced to metallic copper
due to direct transfer of electrons from zinc
to copper ion. During this reaction heat is
also evolved. Now we modify the experiment
in such a manner that for the same redox
reaction transfer of electrons takes place
indirectly. This necessitates the separation
of zinc metal from copper sulphate solution.
We take copper sulphate solution in a beaker
and put a copper strip or rod in it. We also
take zinc sulphate solution in another beaker
and put a zinc rod or strip in it. Now reaction
takes place in either of the beakers and at the
interface of the metal and its salt solution in
each beaker both the reduced and oxidized
forms of the same species are present. These
represent the species in the reduction and
oxidation half reactions. A redox couple is
defined as having together the oxidised and
reduced forms of a substance taking part in
an oxidation or reduction half reaction.
This is represented by separating the
oxidised form from the reduced form by
a vertical line or a slash representing an
interface (e.g. solid/solution). For example
in this experiment the two redox couples

The set-up for Daniell cell. Electrons
produced at the anode due to oxidation
of Zn travel through the external circuit
to the cathode where these reduce the
copper ions. The circuit is completed
inside the cell by the migration of ions
through the salt bridge. It may be noted
that the direction of current is opposite to
the direction of electron flow.

are represented as Zn2+/Zn and Cu2+/Cu.
In both cases, oxidised form is put before
the reduced form. Now we put the beaker
containing copper sulphate solution and the
beaker containing zinc sulphate solution
side by side (Fig. 7.3). We connect solutions
in two beakers by a salt bridge (a U-tube
containing a solution of potassium chloride
or ammonium nitrate usually solidified by
boiling with agar agar and later cooling to a
jelly like substance). This provides an electric
contact between the two solutions without
allowing them to mix with each other. The
zinc and copper rods are connected by a
metallic wire with a provision for an ammeter
and a switch. The set-up as shown in Fig.7.3
is known as Daniell cell. When the switch is
in the off position, no reaction takes place in
either of the beakers and no current flows
through the metallic wire. As soon as the
switch is in the on position, we make the
following observations:
1. The transfer of electrons now does not
take place directly from Zn to Cu2+ but
through the metallic wire connecting the
two rods as is apparent from the arrow
which indicates the flow of current.
2. The electricity from solution in one beaker
to solution in the other beaker flows by
the migration of ions through the salt
bridge. We know that the flow of current
is possible only if there is a potential
difference between the copper and zinc
rods known as electrodes here.
The potential associated with each
electrode is known as electrode potential.
If the concentration of each species taking
part in the electrode reaction is unity (if any
gas appears in the electrode reaction, it is
confined to 1 atmospheric pressure) and
further the reaction is carried out at 298K,
then the potential of each electrode is said
to be the Standard Electrode Potential. By
convention, the standard electrode potential
(E) of hydrogen electrode is 0.00 volts. The
electrode potential value for each electrode
process is a measure of the relative tendency
of the active species in the process to remain
in the oxidised/reduced form. A negative E
means that the redox couple is a stronger

redox reactions

251

reducing agent than the H+/H2 couple. A
positive E means that the redox couple is a
weaker reducing agent than the H+/H2 couple.
The standard electrode potentials are very
important and we can get a lot of other useful

information from them. The values of standard
electrode potentials for some selected electrode
processes (reduction reactions) are given in
Table 7.1. You will learn more about electrode
reactions and cells in Class XII.

SUMMARY
Redox reactions form an important class of reactions in which oxidation and reduction
occur simultaneously. Three tier conceptualisation viz, classical, electronic and oxidation
number, which is usually available in the texts, has been presented in detail. Oxidation,
reduction, oxidising agent (oxidant) and reducing agent (reductant) have been viewed
according to each conceptualisation. Oxidation numbers are assigned in accordance with a
consistent set of rules. Oxidation number and ion-electron method both are useful means in
writing equations for the redox reactions. Redox reactions are classified into four categories:
combination, decomposition displacement and disproportionation reactions. The concept of
redox couple and electrode processes is introduced here. The redox reactions find wide
applications in the study of electrode processes and cells.

of organic compounds.

In the previous unit you have learnt that the element
carbon has the unique property called catenation due to
which it forms covalent bonds with other carbon atoms.
It also forms covalent bonds with atoms of other elements
like hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus
and halogens. The resulting compounds are studied
under a separate branch of chemistry called organic
chemistry. This unit incorporates some basic principles
and techniques of analysis required for understanding the
formation and properties of organic compounds.
8.1 General Introduction
Organic compounds are vital for sustaining life on earth
and include complex molecules like genetic information
bearing deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and proteins that
constitute essential compounds of our blood, muscles and
skin. Organic compounds appear in materials like clothing,
fuels, polymers, dyes and medicines. These are some of
the important areas of application of these compounds.
Science of organic chemistry is about two hundred
years old. Around the year 1780, chemists began to
distinguish between organic compounds obtained from
plants and animals and inorganic compounds prepared
from mineral sources. Berzilius, a Swedish chemist
proposed that a ‘vital force’ was responsible for the
formation of organic compounds. However, this notion
was rejected in 1828 when F. Wohler synthesised an
organic compound, urea from an inorganic compound,
ammonium cyanate.
NH4CNO
Ammonium cyanate

NH2CONH2
Urea

The pioneering synthesis of acetic acid by Kolbe
(1845) and that of methane by Berthelot (1856) showed
conclusively that organic compounds could be synthesised
from inorganic sources in a laboratory.

The development of electronic theory of
covalent bonding ushered organic chemistry
into its modern shape.
8.2

TETRAVALENCE OF CARBON:
SHAPES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

8.2.1 The Shapes of Carbon Compounds
The knowledge of fundamental concepts of
molecular structure helps in understanding
and predicting the properties of organic
compounds. You have already learnt theories
of valency and molecular structure in Unit 4.
Also, you already know that tetravalence of
carbon and the formation of covalent bonds
by it are explained in terms of its electronic
configuration and the hybridisation of s and p
orbitals. It may be recalled that formation and
the shapes of molecules like methane (CH4),
ethene (C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) are explained
in terms of the use of sp3, sp2 and sp hybrid
orbitals by carbon atoms in the respective
molecules.

Thus, in H2C=CH2 molecule all the atoms
must be in the same plane. The p orbitals are
mutually parallel and both the p orbitals are
perpendicular to the plane of the molecule.
Rotation of one CH2 fragment with respect
to other interferes with maximum overlap
of p orbitals and, therefore, such rotation
about carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) is
restricted. The electron charge cloud of the π
bond is located above and below the plane of
bonding atoms. This results in the electrons
being easily available to the attacking
reagents. In general, π bonds provide the most
reactive centres in the molecules containing
multiple bonds.
Problem 8.1
How many σ and π bonds are present in
each of the following molecules?
(a) HC≡CCH=CHCH3 (b) CH2=C=CHCH3
Solution

Hybridisation influences the bond length
and bond enthalpy (strength) in compounds.
The sp hybrid orbital contains more s
character and hence it is closer to its nucleus
and forms shorter and stronger bonds than
the sp3 hybrid orbital. The sp2 hybrid orbital
is intermediate in s character between sp
and sp3 and, hence, the length and enthalpy
of the bonds it forms, are also intermediate
between them. The change in hybridisation
affects the electronegativity of carbon. The
greater the s character of the hybrid orbitals,
the greater is the electronegativity. Thus, a
carbon atom having an sp hybrid orbital with
50% s character is more electronegative than
that possessing sp2 or sp3 hybridised orbitals.
This relative electronegativity is reflected in
several physical and chemical properties of
the molecules concerned, about which you
will learn in later units.

8.3 	STRUCTURAL RepresenTATIONS
OF organic COMPOUNDs
8.3.1 	Complete, Condensed and Bond-line
Structural Formulas
Structures of organic compounds are
represented in several ways. The Lewis
structure or dot structure, dash structure,
condensed structure and bond line structural
formulas are some of the specific types. The
Lewis structures, however, can be simplified
by representing the two-electron covalent
bond by a dash (–). Such a structural formula
focuses on the electrons involved in bond
formation. A single dash represents a single
bond, double dash is used for double bond
and a triple dash represents triple bond. Lonepairs of electrons on heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen,
nitrogen, sulphur, halogens etc.) may or may
not be shown. Thus, ethane (C2H6), ethene
(C2H4), ethyne (C2H2) and methanol (CH3OH)
can be represented by the following structural
formulas. Such structural representations are
called complete structural formulas.

Similarly, CH3CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3
can be further condensed to CH3(CH2)6CH3.
For further simplification, organic chemists
use another way of r epr esenting the
structures, in which only lines are used.
In this bond-line structural representation
of organic compounds, carbon and
hydrogen atoms are not shown and the
lines representing carbon-carbon bonds are
drawn in a zig-zag fashion. The only atoms
specifically written are oxygen, chlorine,
nitrogen etc. The terminals denote methyl
(–CH3) groups (unless indicated otherwise by
a functional group), while the line junctions
denote carbon atoms bonded to appropriate
number of hydrogens required to satisfy the
valency of the carbon atoms. Some of the
examples are represented as follows:
(i) 3-Methyloctane can be represented in
various forms as:
(a) CH3CH2CHCH2CH2CH2CH2CH3

|

CH3
(b)

		

Ethane

Ethene

(c)
Ethyne

Methanol

These structural formulas can be further
abbreviated by omitting some or all of the
dashes representing covalent bonds and by
indicating the number of identical groups
attached to an atom by a subscript. The
resulting expression of the compound is
called a condensed structural formula. Thus,
ethane, ethene, ethyne and methanol can be
written as:
H2C=CH2
HC≡CH
CH3OH
CH3CH3
Ethane
Ethene
Ethyne

8.3.2

Three-Dimensional
Representation of Organic
Molecules
The three-dimensional (3-D) structure of
organic molecules can be represented on
paper by using certain conventions. For
) and dashed
example, by using solid (
) wedge formula, the 3-D image of a
(
molecule from a two-dimensional picture
can be perceived. In these formulas the
solid-wedge is used to indicate a bond
projecting out of the plane of paper, towards
the observer. The dashed-wedge is used to
depict the bond projecting out of the plane of
the paper and away from the observer. Wedges
are shown in such a way that the broad end of
the wedge is towards the observer. The bonds
lying in plane of the paper are depicted by
using a normal line (—). 3-D representation of
methane molecule on paper has been shown
in Fig. 8.1

Molecular models are physical devices
that are used for a better visualisation and
perception of three-dimensional shapes
of organic molecules. These are made of
wood, plastic or metal and are commercially
available. Commonly three types of molecular
models are used: (1) Framework model, (2)
Ball-and-stick model, and (3) Space filling
model. In the framework model only the
bonds connecting the atoms of a molecule
and not the atoms themselves are shown.
This model emphasizes the pattern of
bonds of a molecule while ignoring the size
of atoms. In the ball-and-stick model, both
the atoms and the bonds are shown. Balls
represent atoms and the stick denotes a
bond. Compounds containing C=C (e.g.,
ethene) can best be represented by using
springs in place of sticks. These models are
referred to as ball-and-spring model. The
space-filling model emphasises the relative
size of each atom based on its van der Waals
radius. Bonds are not shown in this model.
It conveys the volume occupied by each atom
in the molecule. In addition to these models,
computer graphics can also be used for
molecular modelling.

Classification of Organic
Compounds

The existing large number of organic
compounds and their ever -increasing
numbers has made it necessary to classify
them on the basis of their structures. Organic
compounds are broadly classified as follows:

261

(homocyclic).

Cyclopropane Cyclohexene

Cyclohexane

Sometimes atoms other than carbon are
also present in the ring (heterocylic).
Tetrahydrofuran given below is an example
of this type of compound:

Tetrahydrofuran
These exhibit some of the properties similar
to those of aliphatic compounds.
(b) Aromatic compounds

I. Acyclic or open chain compounds
These compounds are also called as aliphatic
compounds and consist of straight or
branched chain compounds, for example:

Aromatic compounds are special types of
compounds. You will learn about these
compounds in detail in Unit 9. These include
benzene and other related ring compounds
(benzenoid). Like alicyclic compounds,
aromatic comounds may also have hetero
atom in the ring. Such compounds are called
hetrocyclic aromatic compounds. Some of
the examples of various types of aromatic
compounds are:
Benzenoid aromatic compounds

CH3CH3
Ethane
Isobutane

Benzene

Aniline

Naphthalene

Heterocyclic aromatic compounds

Furan
Thiophene
Pyridine
Organic compounds can also be classified
on the basis of functional groups, into families
or homologous series.
8.4.1 Functional Group
The functional group is an atom or a group
of atoms joined to the carbon chain which is
responsible for the characteristic chemical
properties of the organic compounds. The
examples are hydroxyl group (–OH), aldehyde
group (–CHO) and carboxylic acid group (–
COOH) etc.

so because it is found in citrus fruits and the
acid found in red ant is named formic acid
since the Latin word for ant is formica. These
names are traditional and are considered
as trivial or common names. Some common
names are followed even today. For example,
Buckminsterfullerene is a common name
given to the newly discovered C60 cluster (a
form of carbon) noting its structural similarity
to the geodesic domes popularised by the
famous architect R. Buckminster Fuller.
Common names are useful and in many
cases indispensable, particularly when the
alternative systematic names are lengthy and
complicated. Common names of some organic
compounds are given in Table 8.1.
Table 8.1

8.4.2 Homologous Series
A group or a series of organic compounds each
containing a characteristic functional group
forms a homologous series and the members of
the series are called homologues. The members
of a homologous series can be represented by
general molecular formula and the successive
members differ from each other in molecular
formula by a –Ch2 unit. There are a number
of homologous series of organic compounds.
Some of these are alkanes, alkenes, alkynes,
haloalkanes, alkanols, alkanals, alkanones,
alkanoic acids, amines etc.
It is also possible that a compound contains
two or more identical or different functional
groups. This gives rise to polyfunctional
compounds.
8.5 	NOMENCLATURE OF ORGANIC
COMPOUNDS
Organic chemistry deals with millions of
compounds. In order to clearly identify
them, a systematic method of naming has
been developed and is known as the IUPAC
(International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry) system of nomenclature. In this
systematic nomenclature, the names are
correlated with the structure such that the
reader or listener can deduce the structure
from the name.
Before the IUPAC system of nomenclature,
however, organic compounds were assigned
names based on their origin or certain
properties. For instance, citric acid is named

Common or Trivial Names of Some
Organic Compounds

8.5.1 The IUPAC System of Nomenclature
A systematic name of an organic compound
is generally derived by identifying the parent
hydrocarbon and the functional group(s)
attached to it. See the example given below.



Unit 8.indd 262

11/10/2022 15:20:58

organic chemistry – some basic principles and techniques

By further using prefixes and suffixes, the
parent name can be modified to obtain the
actual name. Compounds containing carbon
and hydrogen only are called hydrocarbons.
A hydrocarbon is termed saturated if it
contains only carbon-carbon single bonds.
The IUPAC name for a homologous series of
such compounds is alkane. Paraffin (Latin:
little affinity) was the earlier name given to
these compounds. Unsaturated hydrocarbons
are those, which contain at least one carboncarbon double or triple bond.
8.5.2	IUPAC Nomenclature of Alkanes
Straight chain hydrocarbons: The names
of such compounds are based on their chain
structure, and end with suffix ‘-ane’ and carry
a prefix indicating the number of carbon
atoms present in the chain (except from CH4
to C4H10, where the prefixes are derived from
trivial names). The IUPAC names of some
straight chain saturated hydrocarbons are
given in Table 8.2. The alkanes in Table
8.2 differ from each other by merely the
number of -CH2 groups in the chain. They are
homologues of alkane series.
Table 8.2	IUPAC Names of Some Unbranched
Saturated Hydrocarbons

263

In order to name such compounds, the names
of alkyl groups are prefixed to the name of
parent alkane. An alkyl group is derived
from a saturated hydrocarbon by removing
a hydrogen atom from carbon. Thus, CH4
becomes -CH3 and is called methyl group. An
alkyl group is named by substituting ‘yl’ for
‘ane’ in the corresponding alkane. Some alkyl
groups are listed in Table 8.3.
Table 8.3 Some Alkyl Groups

Abbreviations are used for some alkyl
groups. For example, methyl is abbreviated as
Me, ethyl as Et, propyl as Pr and butyl as Bu.
The alkyl groups can be branched also. Thus,
propyl and butyl groups can have branched
structures as shown below.

Branched chain hydrocarbons: In a
branched chain compound small chains of
carbon atoms are attached at one or more
carbon atoms of the parent chain. The small
carbon chains (branches) are called alkyl
groups. For example:
CH3–CH–CH2–CH3 CH3–CH–CH2–CH–CH3

Common branched groups have specific
trivial names. For example, the propyl groups
can either be n-propyl group or isopropyl
group. The branched butyl groups are called
sec-butyl, isobutyl and tert-butyl group.
We also encounter the structural unit,
–CH2C(CH3)3, which is called neopentyl group.
Nomenclature of branched chain alkanes:
We encounter a number of branched chain
alkanes. The rules for naming them are given

1. First of all, the longest carbon chain in
the molecule is identified. In the example
(I) given below, the longest chain has nine
carbons and it is considered as the parent
or root chain. Selection of parent chain as
shown in (II) is not correct because it has
only eight carbons.

separated from the groups by hyphens
and there is no break between methyl
and nonane.]
4. If two or more identical substituent
groups are present then the numbers
are separated by commas. The names of
identical substituents are not repeated,
instead prefixes such as di (for 2), tri
(for 3), tetra (for 4), penta (for 5), hexa (for
6) etc. are used. While writing the name
of the substituents in alphabetical order,
these prefixes, however, are not considered.
Thus, the following compounds are
named as:
CH3

2. The carbon atoms of the parent chain are
numbered to identify the parent alkane
and to locate the positions of the carbon
atoms at which branching takes place due
to the substitution of alkyl group in place
of hydrogen atoms. The numbering is
done in such a way that the branched
carbon atoms get the lowest possible
numbers. Thus, the numbering in the
above example should be from left to right
(branching at carbon atoms 2 and 6) and
not from right to left (giving numbers
4 and 8 to the carbon atoms at which
branches are attached).

3. The names of alkyl groups attached
as a branch are then prefixed to the
name of the parent alkane and position
of the substituents is indicated by the
appropriate numbers. If different alkyl
groups are present, they are listed in
alphabetical order. Thus, name for the
compound shown above is: 6-ethyl-2methylnonane. [Note: the numbers are

The name of such branched chain alkyl group
is placed in parenthesis while naming the
compound. While writing the trivial names
of substituents’ in alphabetical order, the
prefixes iso- and neo- are considered to be
the part of the fundamental name of alkyl
group. The prefixes sec- and tert- are not
considered to be the part of the fundamental
name. The use of iso and related common
prefixes for naming alkyl groups is also
allowed by the IUPAC nomenclature as long
as these are not further substituted. In multisubstituted compounds, the following rules
may aso be remembered:
• If there happens to be two chains of equal
size, then that chain is to be selected which
contains more number of side chains.
• After selection of the chain, numbering
is to be done from the end closer to the
substituent.

Cyclic Compounds: A saturated monocyclic

Nomenclature of Organic
Compounds having Functional
Group(s)
A functional group, as defined earlier, is an
atom or a group of atoms bonded together in
a unique manner which is usually the site of



Unit 8.indd 265

chemistry

chemical reactivity in an organic molecule.
Compounds having the same functional
group undergo similar reactions. For example,
CH 3OH, CH 3CH 2OH, and (CH 3) 2CHOH —
all having -OH functional group liberate
hydrogen on reaction with sodium metal.
The presence of functional groups enables
systematisation of organic compounds into
different classes. Examples of some functional
groups with their prefixes and suffixes along
with some examples of organic compounds
possessing these are given in Table 8.4.
First of all, the functional group present
in the molecule is identified which determines
the choice of appropriate suffix. The longest
chain of carbon atoms containing the
functional group is numbered in such a way
that the functional group is attached at the
carbon atom possessing lowest possible
number in the chain. By using the suffix as
given in Table 8.4, the name of the compound
is arrived at.
In the case of polyfunctional compounds,
one of the functional groups is chosen as the
principal functional group and the compound
is then named on that basis. The remaining
functional groups, which are subordinate
functional groups, are named as substituents
using the appropriate prefixes. The choice of
principal functional group is made on the basis
of order of preference. The order of decreasing
priority for some functional groups is:
-COOH, –SO3H, -COOR (R=alkyl group), COCl,
-CONH2, -CN,-HC=O, >C=O, -OH, -NH2, >
C=C<, -C≡C- .
The –R, C6H5-, halogens (F, Cl, Br, I), –NO2,
alkoxy (–OR) etc. are always prefix
substituents. Thus, a compound containing
both an alcohol and a keto group is named
as hydroxyalkanone since the keto group is
preferred to the hydroxyl group.
For example, HOCH2(CH2)3CH2COCH3 will
be named as 7-hydroxyheptan-2-one and not
as 2-oxoheptan -7-ol. Similarly, BrCH2CH=CH2
is named as 3-bromoprop-1-ene and not
1-bromoprop-2-ene.
If more than one functional group of the
same type are present, their number is
indicated by adding di, tri, etc. before the

class suffix. In such cases the full name of the
parent alkane is written before the class suffix.
For example CH2(OH)CH2(OH) is named as
ethane–1,2–diol. However, the ending – ne of
the parent alkane is dropped in the case of
compounds having more than one double or
triple bond; for example, CH2=CH-CH=CH2 is
named as buta–1,3–diene.
Problem 8.8
Write the IUPAC names of the compounds
i-iv from their given structures.

Solution

•
•

•

The functional group present is an
alcohol (OH). Hence the suffix is ‘-ol’.
The longest chain containing -OH
has eight carbon atoms. Hence the
corresponding saturated hydrocarbon is octane.
The -OH is on carbon atom 3. In
addition, a methyl group is attached
at 6th carbon.
Hence, the systematic name of this
compound is 6-Methyloctan-3-ol.

Solution
The functional group present is ketone
(>C=O), hence suffix ‘-one’. Presence
of two keto groups is indicated by ‘di’,
hence suffix becomes ‘dione’. The two
keto groups are at carbons 2 and 4.
The longest chain contains 6 carbon
atoms, hence, parent hydrocarbon is
hexane. Thus, the systematic name is
Hexane-2,4-dione.

chemistry

Solution
Here, two functional groups namely
ketone and carboxylic acid are present.
The principal functional group is the
carboxylic acid group; hence the parent
chain will be suffixed with ‘oic’ acid.
Numbering of the chain starts from
carbon of – COOH functional group.
The keto group in the chain at carbon
5 is indicated by ‘oxo’. The longest
chain including the principal functional
group has 6 carbon atoms; hence the
parent hydrocarbon is hexane. The
compound is, therefore, named as
5-Oxohexanoic acid.

Solution
The two C=C functional groups are
present at carbon atoms 1 and 3, while
the C≡C functional group is present at
carbon 5. These groups are indicated by
suffixes ‘diene’ and ‘yne’ respectively. The
longest chain containing the functional
groups has 6 carbon atoms; hence the
parent hydrocarbon is hexane. The name
of compound, therefore, is Hexa-1,3dien-5-yne.
Problem 8.9
Derive the structure of (i) 2-Chlorohexane,
(ii) Pent-4-en-2-ol, (iii) 3- Nitrocyclohexene,
(iv) Cyclohex-2-en-1-ol, (v) 6-Hydroxyheptanal.
Solution
(i) ‘hexane’ indicates the presence of
6 carbon atoms in the chain. The
functional group chloro is present at
carbon 2. Hence, the structure of the
compound is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH(Cl)CH3.
(ii) ‘pent’ indicates that parent
hydrocarbon contains 5 carbon atoms
in the chain. ‘en’ and ‘ol’ correspond to
the functional groups C=C and -OH at
carbon atoms 4 and 2 respectively. Thus,
the structure is
CH2=CHCH2CH (OH)CH3.

(iii) Six membered ring containing a
carbon-carbon double bond is implied
by cyclohexene, which is numbered as
shown in (I). The prefix 3-nitro means
that a nitro group is present on C-3.
Thus, complete structural formula of the
compound is (II). Double bond is suffixed
functional group whereas NO2 is prefixed
functional group therefore double bond
gets preference over –NO2 group:

(iv) ‘1-ol’ means that a -OH group is
present at C-1. OH is suffixed functional
group and gets preference over C=C
bond. Thus the structure is as shown
in (II):

(v) ‘heptanal’ indicates the compound
to be an aldehyde containing 7 carbon
atoms in the parent chain. The
‘6-hydroxy’ indicates that -OH group is
present at carbon 6. Thus, the structural
formula of the compound is: CH3CH(OH)
CH2CH2CH2CH2CHO. Carbon atom of –
CHO group is included while numbering
the carbon chain.
8.5.4	Nomenclature of Substituted
Benzene Compounds
For IUPAC nomenclature of substituted
benzene compounds, the substituent is
placed as prefix to the word benzene as shown
in the following examples. However, common
names (written in bracket below) of many
substituted benzene compounds are also
universally used.

Methylbenzene
(Toluene)

Methoxybenzene
(Anisole)

Nitrobenzene

Aminobenzene
(Aniline)

Bromobenzene

If benzene ring is disubstituted,
the position of substituents is defined
by numbering the carbon atoms of the
ring such that the substituents are
located at the lowest numbers possible.
For example, the compound(b) is named
as 1,3-dibromobenzene and not as
1,5-dibromobenzene.

269

Substituent of the base compound is
assigned number1 and then the direction
of numbering is chosen such that the
next substituent gets the lowest number.
The substituents appear in the name in
alphabetical order. Some examples are given
below.

1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene
(not 4-chloro,1,3-dinitrobenzene)

2-Chloro-1-methyl-4-nitrobenzene
(not 4-methyl-5-chloro-nitrobenzene)

(a)
1,2-Dibromobenzene

(b)
1,3-Dibromobenzene

(c)
1,4-Dibromobenzene

In the trivial system of nomenclature
the terms ortho (o), meta (m) and para (p)
are used as prefixes to indicate the relative
positions 1,2;1,3 and 1,4 respectively. Thus,
1,3-dibr omobenzene (b) is named as
m-dibromobenzene (meta is abbreviated as
m-) and the other isomers of dibromobenzene
1,2-(a) and 1,4-(c), are named as ortho (or
just o-) and para (or just p-)-dibromobenzene,
respectively.
For tri - or higher substituted benzene
derivatives, these prefixes cannot be used
and the compounds are named by identifying
substituent positions on the ring by following
the lowest locant rule. In some cases, common
name of benzene derivatives is taken as the
base compound.

2-Chloro-4-methylanisole 4-Ethyl-2-methylaniline

3,4-Dimethylphenol

When a benzene ring is attached to an
alkane with a functional group, it is considered
as substituent, instead of a parent. The name
for benzene as substituent is phenyl (C6H5-,
also abbreviated as Ph).

8.6 ISOMERISM
The phenomenon of existence of two or more
compounds possessing the same molecular
formula but different properties is known
as isomerism. Such compounds are called
as isomers. The following flow chart shows
different types of isomerism.
8.6.1 Structural Isomerism
Compounds having the same molecular
formula but different structures (manners
in which atoms are linked) are classified as
structural isomers. Some typical examples
of different types of structural isomerism are
given below:
(i) Chain isomerism: When two or more
compounds have similar molecular formula but

(ii) Position isomerism: When two or
more compounds differ in the position of
substituent atom or functional group on
the carbon skeleton, they are called position
isomers and this phenomenon is termed
as position isomerism. For example, the
molecular formula C3H 8O represents two
alcohols:

CH3CH2CH2OH

OH

CH3−CH-CH3

Propan-1-ol		

Propan-2-ol

(iii) Functional group isomerism: Two or
more compounds having the same molecular
formula but different functional groups
are called functional isomers and this
phenomenon is termed as functional group
isomerism. For example, the molecular
formula C3H6O represents an aldehyde and
a ketone:

alkyl chains on either side of the functional
group in the molecule. For example, C4H10O
represents methoxypropane (CH3OC3H7) and
ethoxyethane (C2H5OC2H5).
8.6.2 Stereoisomerism
The compounds that have the same
constitution and sequence of covalent bonds
but differ in relative positions of their atoms
or groups in space are called stereoisomers.
This special type of isomerism is called as
stereoisomerism and can be classified as
geometrical and optical isomerism.

ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISM
In an organic reaction, the organic molecule
(also referred as a substrate) reacts with an
appropriate attacking reagent and leads to
the formation of one or more intermediate(s)
and finally product(s)
The general reaction is depicted as follows :
Attacking
Reagent [Intermediate]
Product(s)
Organic
molecule
Byproducts
(Substrate)

Substrate is that reactant which supplies
carbon to the new bond and the other reactant
is called reagent. If both the reactants
supply carbon to the new bond then choice
is arbitrary and in that case the molecule on
which attention is focused is called substrate.
In such a reaction a covalent bond
between two carbon atoms or a carbon and
some other atom is broken and a new bond is
formed. A sequential account of each step,
describing details of electron movement,
energetics during bond cleavage and bond
formation, and the rates of transformation
of reactants into products (kinetics) is
referred to as reaction mechanism. The
knowledge of reaction mechanism helps

271

in understanding the reactivity of organic
compounds and in planning strategy for their
synthesis.
In the following sections, we shall learn
some of the principles that explain how these
reactions take place.
8.7.1 Fission of a Covalent Bond
A covalent bond can get cleaved either by : (i)
heterolytic cleavage, or by (ii) homolytic
cleavage.
In heterolytic cleavage, the bond breaks
in such a fashion that the shared pair of
electrons remains with one of the fragments.
After heterolysis, one atom has a sextet
electronic structure and a positive charge and
the other, a valence octet with at least one lone
pair and a negative charge. Thus, heterolytic
+
cleavage of bromomethane will give C H3 and
Br– as shown below.

A species having a carbon atom possessing
sextext of electrons and a positive charge is
called a carbocation (earlier called carbonium
ion). The H3 ion is known as a methyl cation
or methyl carbonium ion. Carbocations are
classified as primary, secondary or tertiary
depending on whether one, two or three
carbons are directly attached to the positively
charged carbon. Some+ other examples of
cation, a
carbocations are: CH3C H2 (ethyl
+
primary carbocation), (CH3)2C H (isopropyl+
cation, a secondary carbocation), and (CH3)3C
(tert-butyl cation, a tertiary carbocation).
Carbocations are highly unstable and
reactive species. Alkyl groups directly
attached to the positively charged carbon
stabilise the carbocations due to inductive
and hyperconjugation effects, which you will
be studying in the sections 8.7.5 and 8.7.9.
The+ observed+ order of carbocation
stability
+
+
is: C H3 < CH3CH2 < (CH3)2CH < (CH3)3C. These
carbocations have trigonal planar shape
with positively charged carbon+ being sp 2
hybridised. Thus, the shape of C H3 may be
considered as being derived from the overlap
of three equivalent C(sp2) hybridised orbitals
with 1s orbital of each of the three hydrogen

C(sp 2)–H(1s) sigma bond. The remaining
carbon orbital is perpendicular to the
molecular plane and contains no electrons.
[Fig. 8.3(a)].

curved arrow. Such cleavage results in
the formation of neutral species (atom or
group) which contains an unpaired electron.
These species are called free radicals. Like
carbocations and carbanions, free radicals are
also very reactive. A homolytic cleavage can be
shown as:

				
Alkyl
				
free radical
Alkyl radicals are classified as primary,
secondary, or tertiary. Alkyl radical stability
increases as we proceed from primary to
tertiary:

Fig. 8.3 (a) Shape of methyl carbocation

The heterolytic cleavage can also give a
species in which carbon gets the shared
pair of electrons. For example, when group
Z attached to the carbon leaves without

electron pair, the methyl anion

is

formed. Such a carbon species carrying a
negative charge on carbon atom is called
carbanion. Carbon in carbanion is generally
sp3 hybridised and its structure is distorted
tetrahedron as shown in Fig. 8.3(b).

Fig. 8.3 (b) Shape of methyl carbanion

Carbanions are also unstable and reactive
species. The organic reactions which proceed
through heterolytic bond cleavage are called
ionic or heteropolar or just polar reactions.
In homolytic cleavage, one of the electrons
of the shared pair in a covalent bond goes
with each of the bonded atoms. Thus, in
homolytic cleavage, the movement of a
single electron takes place instead of an
electron pair. The single electron movement

,

Organic reactions, which proceed by
homolytic fission are called free radical or
homopolar or nonpolar reactions.
8.7.2 Substrate and Reagent
Ions are generally not formed in the reactions
of organic compounds. Molecules as such
participate in the reaction. It is convenient to
name one reagent as substrate and other as
reagent. In general, a molecule whose carbon
is involved in new bond formation is called
substrate and the other one is called reagent.
When carbon-carbon bond is formed, the
choice of naming the reactants as substrate
and reagent is arbitrary and depends on
molecule under observation. Example:
(i) CH2 = CH2 + Br2 →
Substrate
Reagent

CH2 Br – CH2Br

Nucleophiles and Electrophiles
Reagents attack the reactive site of the
substrate. The reactive site may be electron

organic chemistry – some basic principles and techniques

deficient portion of the molecule (a positive
reactive site) e.g., an atom with incomplete
electron shell or the positive end of the dipole
in the molecule. If the attacking species is
electron rich, it attacks these sites. If attacking
species is electron deficient, the reactive site
for it is that part of the substrate molecule
which can supply electrons, e.g., π electrons
in a double bond.
A reagent that brings an electron pair to
the reactive site is called a nucleophile (Nu:)
i.e., nucleus seeking and the reaction is then
called nucleophilic. A reagent that takes away
an electron pair from reactive site is called
electrophile (E+) i.e., electron seeking and the
reaction is called electrophilic.
During a polar organic reaction, a
nucleophile attacks an electrophilic centre
of the substrate which is that specific atom
or part of the substrate which is electron
deficient. Similarly, the electrophiles attack
at nucleophilic centre, which is the electron
rich centre of the substrate. Thus, the
electrophiles receive electron pair from the
substrate when the two undergo bonding
interaction. A curved-arrow notation is used
to show the movement of an electron pair
from the nucleophile to the electrophile. Some
examples of nucleophiles are the negatively
charged ions with lone pair of electrons such
as hydroxide (HO– ), cyanide (NC–) ions and
carbanions (R3C:–). Neutral molecules such
as
etc., can also act as
nucleophiles due to the presence of lone
pair of electrons. Examples of electrophiles
+
include carbocations (C H 3 ) and neutral
molecules having functional groups like
carbonyl group (>C=O) or alkyl halides
(R 3C-X, where X is a halogen atom). The
carbon atom in carbocations has sextet
configuration; hence, it is electron deficient
and can receive a pair of electrons from the
nucleophiles. In neutral molecules such as
alkyl halides, due to the polarity of the C-X
bond a partial positive charge is generated
on the carbon atom and hence the carbon
atom becomes an electrophilic centre at which
a nucleophile can attack.

notation. It shows how changes in bonding
occur due to electronic redistribution during
the reaction. To show the change in position
of a pair of electrons, curved arrow starts
from the point from where an electron pair is

curved arrow). For example, in transfer of
hydroxide ion giving ethanol and in the
dissociation of chloromethane, the movement
of electron using curved arrows can be
depicted as follows:

8.7.4	Electron Displacement Effects in
Covalent Bonds
The electron displacement in an organic
molecule may take place either in the ground
state under the influence of an atom or a
substituent group or in the presence of an
appropriate attacking reagent. The electron
displacements due to the influence of
an atom or a substituent group present in
the molecule cause permanent polarlisation
of the bond. Inductive effect and resonance
effects are examples of this type of electron
displacements. Temporary electron
displacement effects are seen in a molecule
when a reagent approaches to attack it.
This type of electron displacement is called
electromeric effect or polarisability effect.
In the following sections we will learn about
these types of electronic displacements.

8.7.5	Inductive Effect
When a covalent bond is formed between
atoms of different electronegativity, the
electron density is more towards the more
electronegative atom of the bond. Such a shift
of electron density results in a polar covalent
bond. Bond polarity leads to various electronic
effects in organic compounds.
Let us consider cholorethane (CH3CH2Cl)
in which the C–Cl bond is a polar covalent
bond. It is polarised in such a way that the
carbon-1 gains some positive charge (δ +)
and the chlorine some negative charge (δ–).
The fractional electronic charges on the two
atoms in a polar covalent bond are denoted
by symbol δ (delta) and the shift of electron
density is shown by an arrow that points from
δ+ to δ– end of the polar bond.
δδ+

In turn carbon-1, which has developed
partial positive charge (δ + ) draws some
electron density towards it from the adjacent
C-C bond. Consequently, some positive charge
(δδ+ ) develops on carbon-2 also, where δδ+
symbolises relatively smaller positive charge
as compared to that on carbon – 1. In other
words, the polar C – Cl bond induces polarity
in the adjacent bonds. Such polarisation of
σ-bond caused by the polarisation of adjacent
σ-bond is referred to as the inductive effect.
This effect is passed on to the subsequent
bonds also but the effect decreases rapidly
as the number of intervening bonds increases
and becomes vanishingly small after three
bonds. The inductive effect is related to the
ability of substituent(s) to either withdraw or
donate electron density to the attached carbon
atom. Based on this ability, the substitutents
can be classified as electron-withdrawing or
electron donating groups relative to hydrogen.
Halogens and many other groups such as
nitro (- NO2), cyano (- CN), carboxy (- COOH),
ester (COOR), aryloxy (-OAr, e.g. – OC6H5), etc.
are electron-withdrawing groups. On the other
hand, the alkyl groups like methyl (–CH3) and
ethyl (–CH2–CH3) are usually considered as
electron donating groups.

Problem 8.14
Which bond is more polar in the following
pairs of molecules: (a) H3C-H, H3C-Br
(b) H 3 C-NH 2 , H 3 C-OH (c) H 3 C-OH,
H3C-SH
Solution
(a) C–Br, since Br is more electronegative
than H, (b) C–O, (c) C–O
Problem 8.15
In which C–C bond of CH3CH2CH2Br, the
inductive effect is expected to be the least?
Solution
Magnitude of inductive effect diminishes
as the number of intervening bonds
increases. Hence, the effect is least in the
bond between carbon-3 and hydrogen.
8.7.6 Resonance Structure
There are many organic molecules whose
behaviour cannot be explained by a single Lewis
structure. An example is that of
benzene. Its cyclic structure
containing alternating C–C single
and C=C double bonds shown
is inadequate for explaining its Benzene
characteristic properties.
As per the above representation, benzene
should exhibit two different bond lengths,
due to C–C single and C=C double bonds.
However, as determined experimentally
benzene has a uniform C–C bond distances
of 139 pm, a value intermediate between the
C–C single(154 pm) and C=C double (134
pm) bonds. Thus, the structure of benzene
cannot be represented adequately by the
above structure. Further, benzene can be
represented equally well by the energetically
identical structures I and II.

Therefore, according to the resonance
theory (Unit 4) the actual structure of

275

benzene cannot be adequately represented
by any of these structures, rather it is
a hybrid of the two structures (I and II)
called resonance structures. The resonance
structures (canonical structures or
contributing structures) are hypothetical
and individually do not represent any
real molecule. They contribute to the actual
structure in proportion to their stability.
Another example of resonance is provided
by nitromethane (CH 3NO 2) which can be
represented by two Lewis structures, (I and
II). There are two types of N-O bonds in these
structures.

However, it is known that the two N–O
bonds of nitromethane are of the same
length (intermediate between a N–O single
bond and a N=O double bond). The actual
structure of nitromethane is therefore
a resonance hybrid of the two canonical
forms I and II.
The energy of actual structure of the molecule
(the resonance hybrid) is lower than that of
any of the canonical structures. The difference
in energy between the actual structure and the
lowest energy resonance structure is called the
resonance stabilisation energy or simply
the resonance energy. The more the number
of important contributing structures, the
more is the resonance energy. Resonance is
particularly important when the contributing
structures are equivalent in energy.
The following rules are applied while writing
resonance structures:
The resonance structures have (i) the same
positions of nuclei and (ii) the same number of
unpaired electrons. Among the resonance
structures, the one which has more number
of covalent bonds, all the atoms with octet
of electrons (except hydrogen which has a
duplet), less separation of opposite charges, (a
negative charge if any on more electronegative
atom, a positive charge if any on more
electropositive atom) and more dispersal of
charge, is more stable than others.

Problem 8.16
Write resonance structures of CH3COO–
and show the movement of electrons by
curved arrows.
Solution
First, write the structure and put
unshared pairs of valence electrons on
appropriate atoms. Then draw the arrows
one at a time moving the electrons to get
the other structures.

Problem 8.17
Write resonance structures of
CH2=CH–CHO. Indicate relative stability
of the contributing structures.
Solution

Stability: I > II > III

[I: Most stable, more number of covalent
bonds, each carbon and oxygen atom has
an octet and no separation of opposite
charge II: negative charge on more
electronegative atom and positive charge
on more electropositive atom; III: does
not contribute as oxygen has positive
charge and carbon has negative charge,
hence least stable].
Problem 8.18
Explain why the following two structures,
I and II cannot be the major contributors
to the real structure of CH3COOCH3.

Solution
The two structures are less important
contributors as they involve charge
separation. Additionally, structure
I contains a carbon atom with an
incomplete octet.
8.7.7	Resonance Effect
The resonance effect is defined as ‘the polarity
produced in the molecule by the interaction
of two π-bonds or between a π-bond and
lone pair of electrons present on an adjacent
atom’. The effect is transmitted through the
chain. There are two types of resonance or
mesomeric effect designated as R or M effect.
(i) Positive Resonance Effect (+R effect)
In this effect, the transfer of electrons is away
from an atom or substituent group attached
to the conjugated system. This electron
displacement makes certain positions in the
molecule of high electron densities. This effect
in aniline is shown as :

(ii) Negative Resonance Effect (- R effect)
This effect is observed when the transfer of
electrons is towards the atom or substituent
group attached to the conjugated system.
For example in nitrobenzene this electron
displacement can be depicted as :

The atoms or substituent groups, which
represent +R or –R electron displacement
effects are as follows :
+R effect: – halogen, –OH, –OR, –OCOR, –NH2,
–NHR, –NR2, –NHCOR,
– R effect: – COOH, –CHO, >C=O, – CN, –NO2

organic chemistry – some basic principles and techniques

The presence of alternate single and
double bonds in an open chain or cyclic system
is termed as a conjugated system. These
systems often show abnormal behaviour.
The examples are 1,3- butadiene, aniline
and nitrobenzene etc. In such systems, the
π-electrons are delocalised and the system
develops polarity.
8.7.8	Electromeric Effect (E effect)
It is a temporary effect. The organic compounds
having a multiple bond (a double or triple
bond) show this effect in the presence of
an attacking reagent only. It is defined as
the complete transfer of a shared pair of
π-electrons to one of the atoms joined by a
multiple bond on the demand of an attacking
reagent. The effect is annulled as soon as the
attacking reagent is removed from the domain
of the reaction. It is represented by E and the
shifting of the electrons is shown by a curved
arrow (
). There are two distinct types of
electromeric effect.
(i) Positive Eelctromeric Effect (+E effect) In
this effect the π−electrons of the multiple
bond are transferred to that atom to which
the reagent gets attached. For example:

(ii) Negative Electromeric Effect (–E effect) In
this effect the π - electrons of the multiple
bond are transferred to that atom to which
the attacking reagent does not get attached.
For example:

When inductive and electromeric effects
operate in opposite directions, the electomeric
effect predominates.
8.7.9	Hyperconjugation
Hyperconjugation is a general stabilising
interaction. It involves delocalisation of
σ electrons of C—H bond of an alkyl group
directly attached to an atom of unsaturated

277

system or to an atom with an unshared
p orbital. The σ electrons of C—H bond of the
alkyl group enter into partial conjugation with
the attached unsaturated system or with the
unshared p orbital. Hyperconjugation is a
permanent effect.
To understand hyperconjugation effect, let
+
us take an example of CH3 C H2 (ethyl cation) in
which the positively charged carbon atom has
an empty p orbital. One of the C-H bonds of
the methyl group can align in the plane of this
empty p orbital and the electrons constituting
the C-H bond in plane with this p orbital can
then be delocalised into the empty p orbital
as depicted in Fig. 8.4 (a).

Fig. 8.4(a)

Orbital diagram showing
hyperconjugation in ethyl cation

This type of overlap stabilises the
carbocation because electron density from
the adjacent σ bond helps in dispersing the
positive charge.

In general, greater the number of alkyl
groups attached to a positively charged carbon
atom, the greater is the hyperconjugation
interaction and stabilisation of the cation.
Thus, we have the following relative stability
of carbocations :

Problem 8.19
+
Explain why (CH 3) 3C is more stable
+

+

than CH3C H2 and C H3 is the least stable
cation.
Hyperconjugation is also possible in
alkenes and alkylarenes.
Delocalisation of electrons by
hyperconjugation in the case of alkene can
be depicted as in Fig. 8.4(b).

Fig. 8.4(b)

Orbital diagram showing
hyperconjugation in propene

There are various ways of looking at the
hyperconjugative effect. One of the way is to
regard C—H bond as possessing partial ionic
character due to resonance.

Solution
+
Hyperconjugation interaction in (CH3)3C is+
+
greater than in CH3C H2 as the (CH3)3C
+
has nine C-H bonds. In C H3, vacant p
orbital is perpendicular to the plane
in which C-H bonds lie; hence cannot
+
overlap with it. Thus, C H 3 lacks
hyperconjugative stability.
8.7.10	Types of Organic Reactions and
Mechanisms
Organic reactions can be classified into the
following categories:
(i) Substitution reactions
(ii) Addition reactions
(iii) Elimination reactions
(iv) Rearrangement reactions
You will be studying these reactions in
Unit 9 and later in class XII.
8.8	Methods of Purification of
Organic Compounds
Once an organic compound is extracted
from a natural source or synthesised in the
laboratory, it is essential to purify it. Various
methods used for the purification of organic
compounds are based on the nature of the
compound and the impurity present in it.
The common techniques used for
purification are as follows :
(i) Sublimation
(ii) Crystallisation
(iii) Distillation
(iv) Differential extraction and
(v) Chromatography

The hyperconjugation may also be
regarded as no bond resonance.

Finally, the purity of a compound is
ascertained by determining its melting or
boiling point. Most of the pure compounds
have sharp melting points and boiling points.
New methods of checking the purity of an
organic compound are based on different



Unit 8.indd 278

10/10/2022 10:37:35 AM

organic chemistry – some basic principles and techniques

types of chromatographic and spectroscopic
techniques.
8.8.1	Sublimation
You have learnt earlier that on heating, some
solid substances change from solid to vapour
state without passing through liquid state.
The purification technique based on the above
principle is known as sublimation and is used
to separate sublimable compounds from nonsublimable impurities.

279

carefully. On boiling, the vapours of lower
boiling component are formed first. The
vapours are condensed by using a condenser
and the liquid is collected in a receiver.
The vapours of higher boiling component
form later and the liquid can be collected
separately.

8.8.2	Crystallisation
This is one of the most commonly used
techniques for the purification of solid organic
compounds. It is based on the difference in
the solubilities of the compound and the
impurities in a suitable solvent. The impure
compound is dissolved in a solvent in which it
is sparingly soluble at room temperature but
appreciably soluble at higher temperature.
The solution is concentrated to get a nearly
saturated solution. On cooling the solution,
pure compound crystallises out and is
removed by filtration. The filtrate (mother
liquor) contains impurities and small quantity
of the compound. If the compound is highly
soluble in one solvent and very little soluble
in another solvent, crystallisation can be
satisfactorily carried out in a mixture of these
solvents. Impurities, which impart colour to
the solution are removed by adsorbing over
activated charcoal. Repeated crystallisation
becomes necessary for the purification
of compounds containing impurities of
comparable solubilities.
8.8.3	Distillation
This important method is used to separate
(i) volatile liquids from nonvolatile impurities
and (ii) the liquids having sufficient difference
in their boiling points. Liquids having
different boiling points vaporise at different
temperatures. The vapours are cooled and
the liquids so formed are collected separately.
Chloroform (b.p 334 K) and aniline (b.p. 457
K) are easily separated by the technique of
distillation (Fig 8.5). The liquid mixture is
taken in a round bottom flask and heated

Fig.8.5

Simple distillation. The vapours of a
substance formed are condensed and
the liquid is collected in conical flask.

Fractional Distillation: If the difference
in boiling points of two liquids is not much,
simple distillation cannot be used to separate
them. The vapours of such liquids are formed
within the same temperature range and are
condensed simultaneously. The technique of
fractional distillation is used in such cases. In
this technique, vapours of a liquid mixture are
passed through a fractionating column before
condensation. The fractionating column is
fitted over the mouth of the round bottom
flask (Fig.8.6, page 280).
Vapours of the liquid with higher boiling
point condense before the vapours of the
liquid with lower boiling point. The vapours
rising up in the fractionating column become
richer in more volatile component. By the

unit in the fractionating column is called a
theoretical plate. Commercially, columns
with hundreds of plates are available.
One of the technological applications of
fractional distillation is to separate different
fractions of crude oil in petroleum industry.
Distillation under reduced
pressure: This method is
used to purify liquids having
very high boiling points and
those, which decompose at
or below their boiling points.
Such liquids are made to boil
at a temperature lower than
their normal boiling points
by reducing the pressure on
their surface. A liquid boils
at a temperature at which its
vapour pressure is equal to
the external pressure. The
pressure is reduced with
the help of a water pump
or vacuum pump (Fig.8.8).

spent-lye in soap industry by

fraction reach the top of the column first followed by
vapours of higher boiling fractions.

time the vapours reach to the top of the
fractionating column, these are rich in the
more volatile component. Fractionating
columns are available in various sizes and
designs as shown in Fig.8.7. A fractionating
column provides many surfaces for heat
exchange between the ascending vapours
and the descending condensed liquid. Some
of the condensing liquid in the fractionating
column obtains heat from the ascending
vapours and revaporises. The vapours thus
become richer in low boiling component. The
vapours of low boiling component ascend
to the top of the column. On reaching the
top, the vapours become pure in low boiling
component and pass through the condenser
and the pure liquid is collected in a receiver.
After a series of successive distillations, the
remaining liquid in the distillation flask gets
enriched in high boiling component. Each
successive condensation and vaporisation

Distillation under reduced pressure. A liquid boils at a temperature below its
vapour pressure by reducing the pressure.

Steam Distillation: This technique is
applied to separate substances which are
steam volatile and are immiscible with water.
In steam distillation, steam from a steam
generator is passed through a heated flask
containing the liquid to be distilled. The
mixture of steam and the volatile organic
compound is condensed and collected. The
compound is later separated from water using
a separating funnel. In steam distillation,
the liquid boils when the sum of vapour
pressures due to the organic liquid (p1)
and that due to water (p2) becomes equal to
the atmospheric pressure (p), i.e. p =p1+ p2.
Since p1 is lower than p, the organic liquid
vaporises at lower temperature than its
boiling point.
Thus, if one of the substances in the
mixture is water and the other, a water
insoluble substance, then the mixture will boil
close to but below, 373K. A mixture of water
and the substance is obtained which can
be separated by using a separating funnel.
Aniline is separated by this technique from
aniline – water mixture (Fig.8.9, Page 282).

8.8.4	Differential Extraction
When an organic compound is present in an
aqueous medium, it is separated by shaking
it with an organic solvent in which it is more
soluble than in water. The organic solvent and
the aqueous solution should be immiscible
with each other so that they form two distinct
layers which can be separated by separatory
funnel. The organic solvent is later removed
by distillation or by evaporation to get back
the compound. Differential extraction is
carried out in a separatory funnel as shown in
Fig. 8.10 (Page 282). If the organic compound
is less soluble in the organic solvent, a very
large quantity of solvent would be required
to extract even a very small quantity of the
compound. The technique of continuous
extraction is employed in such cases. In this
technique same solvent is repeatedly used for
extraction of the compound.
8.8.5 Chromatography
Chromatography is an important technique
extensively used to separate mixtures into
their components, purify compounds and
also to test the purity of compounds. The

name chromatography is based on the Greek
word chroma, for colour since the method
was first used for the separation of coloured
substances found in plants. In this technique,
the mixture of substances is applied onto a
stationary phase, which may be a solid or a
liquid. A pure solvent, a mixture of solvents,
or a gas is allowed to move slowly over the
stationary phase. The components of the
mixture get gradually separated from one
another. The moving phase is called the
mobile phase.
Based on the principle involved,
chromatography is classified into different
categories. Two of these are:
(a) Adsorption chromatography, and
(b) Partition chromatography.
a) Adsorption Chromatography: Adsorption chromatography is based on the fact
that different compounds are adsorbed on
an adsorbent to different degrees. Commonly
used adsorbents are silica gel and alumina.
When a mobile phase is allowed to move
over a stationary phase (adsorbent), the
components of the mixture move by varying

Fig.8.10 Differential extraction. Extraction of compound takes place based on difference
in solubility

distances over the stationary phase. Following
are two main types of chromatographic
techniques based on the principle of differential
adsorption.
(a) Column chromatography, and
(b) Thin layer chromatography.



Unit 8.indd 282

10/10/2022 10:37:36 AM

organic chemistry – some basic principles and techniques

Column Chromatography: Column
chromatography involves separation of
a mixture over a column of adsorbent
(stationary phase) packed in a glass tube.
The column is fitted with a stopcock at its
lower end (Fig. 8.11). The mixture adsorbed
on adsorbent is placed on the top of the
adsorbent column packed in a glass tube.
An appropriate eluant which is a liquid or a
mixture of liquids is allowed to flow down the
column slowly. Depending upon the degree to
which the compounds are adsorbed, complete
separation takes place. The most readily
adsorbed substances are retained near the top
and others come down to various distances
in the column (Fig.8.11).

The glass plate is then placed in a closed jar
containing the eluant (Fig. 8.12a). As the
eluant rises up the plate, the components of
the mixture move up along with the eluant to
different distances depending on their degree
of adsorption and separation takes place.
The relative adsorption of each component
of the mixture is expressed in terms of its
retardation factor i.e. Rf value (Fig.8.12 b).
Rf =

Distance moved by the solvent from base line (y)

Column chromatography. Different
stages of separation of components
of a mixture.

Thin Layer Chromatography: Thin layer
chromatography (TLC) is another type of
adsorption chromatography, which involves
separation of substances of a mixture over
a thin layer of an adsorbent coated on glass
plate. A thin layer (about 0.2mm thick) of
an adsorbent (silica gel or alumina) is spread
over a glass plate of suitable size. The plate
is known as thin layer chromatography plate
or chromaplate. The solution of the mixture
to be separated is applied as a small spot
about 2 cm above one end of the TLC plate.

The spots of coloured compounds are
visible on TLC plate due to their original colour.
The spots of colourless compounds, which are
invisible to the eye but fluoresce in ultraviolet
light, can be detected by putting the plate under
ultraviolet light. Another detection technique
is to place the plate in a covered jar containing
a few crystals of iodine. Spots of compounds,
which adsorb iodine, will show up as brown
spots. Sometimes an appropriate reagent
may also be sprayed on the plate. For example,
amino acids may be detected by spraying the
plate with ninhydrin solution (Fig.8.12b).

chemistry

Partition Chromatography: Partition
chromatography is based on continuous
differential partitioning of components of
a mixture between stationary and mobile
phases. Paper chromatography is a type
of partition chromatography. In paper
chromatography, a special quality paper
known as chromatography paper is used.
Chromatography paper contains water trapped
in it, which acts as the stationary phase.
A strip of chromatography paper spotted
at the base with the solution of the mixture is
suspended in a suitable solvent or a mixture
of solvents (Fig. 8.13). This solvent acts as the
mobile phase. The solvent rises up the paper
by capillary action and flows over the spot. The
paper selectively retains different components
according to their differing partition in the
two phases. The paper strip so developed is
known as a chromatogram. The spots of the
separated coloured compounds are visible at
different heights from the position of initial

spot on the chromatogram. The spots of the
separated colourless compounds may be
observed either under ultraviolet light or by
the use of an appropriate spray reagent as
discussed under thin layer chromatography.
8.9	Qualitative Analysis of Organic
Compounds
The elements present in organic compounds
are carbon and hydrogen. In addition to
these, they may also contain oxygen, nitrogen,
sulphur, halogens and phosphorus.
8.9.1 Detection of Carbon and Hydrogen
Carbon and hydrogen are detected by heating
the compound with copper(II) oxide. Carbon
present in the compound is oxidised to
carbon dioxide (tested with lime-water, which
develops turbidity) and hydrogen to water
(tested with anhydrous copper sulphate,
which turns blue).

8.9.2 Detection of Other Elements
Nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus
present in an organic compound are detected
by “Lassaigne’s test”. The elements present
in the compound are converted from covalent
form into the ionic form by fusing the
compound with sodium metal. Following
reactions take place:

Cyanide, sulphide and halide of sodium so
formed on sodium fusion are extracted from
the fused mass by boiling it with distilled
water. This extract is known as sodium fusion
extract.
(A) Test for Nitrogen
The sodium fusion extract is boiled with
iron(II) sulphate and then acidified with

organic chemistry – some basic principles and techniques

concentrated sulphuric acid. The formation
of Prussian blue colour confirms the presence
of nitrogen. Sodium cyanide first reacts
with iron(II) sulphate and forms sodium
hexacyanidoferrate(II). On heating with
concentrated sulphuric acid some iron(II)
ions are oxidised to iron(III) ions which
react with sodium hexacyanidoferrate(II)
to produce iron(III) hexacyanidoferrate(II)
(ferriferrocyanide) which is Prussian blue in
colour.

If sodium fusion is carried out with excess
of sodium, the thiocyanate decomposes to

their usual tests.

(C) Test for Halogens
The sodium fusion extract is acidified with
nitric acid and then treated with silver nitrate.
A white precipitate, soluble in ammonium
hydroxide shows the presence of chlorine,
a yellowish precipitate, sparingly soluble in
ammonium hydroxide shows the presence of

285

bromine and a yellow precipitate, insoluble
in ammonium hydroxide shows the presence
of iodine.

X represents a halogen – Cl, Br or I.
If nitrogen or sulphur is also present in the
compound, the sodium fusion extract is
first boiled with concentrated nitric acid to
decompose cyanide or sulphide of sodium
formed during Lassaigne’s test. These ions
would otherwise interfere with silver nitrate
test for halogens.

8.10 Quantitative Analysis
Quantitative analysis of compounds is very
important in organic chemistry. It helps
chemists in the determination of mass per
cent of elements present in a compound. You
have learnt in Unit-1 that mass per cent of
elements is required for the determination of
emperical and molecular formula.
The percentage composition of elements
present in an organic compound is determined
by the following methods:
8.10.1 Carbon and Hydrogen
Both carbon and hydrogen are estimated in
one experiment. A known mass of an organic
compound is burnt in the presence of excess
of oxygen and copper(II) oxide. Carbon and
hydrogen in the compound are oxidised to
carbon dioxide and water respectively.
CxHy + (x + y/4) O2 → x CO2 + (y/2) H2O

Estimation of carbon and hydrogen. Water and carbon dioxide formed on oxidation of substance
are absorbed in anhydrous calcium chloride and potassium hydroxide solutions respectively
contained in U tubes.

The mass of water produced is determined
by passing the mixture through a weighed
U-tube containing anhydrous calcium chloride.
Carbon dioxide is absorbed in another U-tube
containing concentrated solution of potassium
hydroxide. These tubes are connected in series
(Fig. 8.14). The increase in masses of calcium
chloride and potassium hydroxide gives the
amounts of water and carbon dioxide from
which the percentages of carbon and hydrogen
are calculated.
Let the mass of organic compound be
m g, mass of water and carbon dioxide
produced be m1 and m2 g respectively;

Traces of nitrogen oxides formed, if
any, are reduced to nitrogen by passing the
gaseous mixture over a heated copper gauze.
The mixture of gases so produced is collected
over an aqueous solution of potassium
hydroxide which absorbs carbon dioxide.

organic compound, when heated with copper
oxide in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide,
yields free nitrogen in addition to carbon
dioxide and water.

Where p 1 and V 1 are the pressure and
volume of nitrogen, p1 is different from the
atmospheric pressure at which nitrogen gas
is collected. The value of p1 is obtained by
the relation;

(ii) Kjeldahl’s method: The compound
containing nitrogen is heated with concentrated
sulphuric acid. Nitrogen in the compound
gets converted to ammonium sulphate
(Fig. 8.16). The resulting acid mixture is then
heated with excess of sodium hydroxide.
The liberated ammonia gas is absorbed in
an excess of standard solution of sulphuric
acid. The amount of ammonia produced is
determined by estimating the amount of
sulphuric acid consumed in the reaction. It
is done by estimating unreacted sulphuric
acid left after the absorption of ammonia by
titrating it with standard alkali solution. The

A definite mass of an organic compound is
decomposed by heating in a stream of nitrogen
gas. The mixture of gaseous products containing
oxygen is passed over red-hot coke when all

This mixture is passed through warm iodine

oxidised to carbon dioxide producing iodine.

On making the amount of CO produced in
equation (A) equal to the amount of CO used
in equation (B) by multiplying the equations
(A) and (B) by 5 and 2 respectively; we find
that each mole of oxygen liberated from
the compound will produce two moles of
carbondioxide.
Thus 88 g carbon dioxide is obtained if 32 g

Summary
In this unit, we have learnt some basic concepts in structure and reactivity of organic
compounds, which are formed due to covalent bonding. The nature of the covalent bonding
in organic compounds can be described in terms of orbitals hybridisation concept,
according to which carbon can have sp3, sp2 and sp hybridised orbitals. The sp3, sp2 and sp
hybridised carbons are found in compounds like methane, ethene and ethyne respectively.
The tetrahedral shape of methane, planar shape of ethene and linear shape of ethyne can
be understood on the basis of this concept. A sp3 hybrid orbital can overlap with 1s orbital
of hydrogen to give a carbon - hydrogen (C–H) single bond (sigma, σ bond). Overlap of a sp2
orbital of one carbon with sp2 orbital of another results in the formation of a carbon–carbon
σ bond. The unhybridised p orbitals on two adjacent carbons can undergo lateral (sideby-side) overlap to give a pi (π) bond. Organic compounds can be represented by various
structural formulas. The three dimensional representation of organic compounds on paper
can be drawn by wedge and dash formula.
Organic compounds can be classified on the basis of their structure or the functional
groups they contain. A functional group is an atom or group of atoms bonded together in a
unique fashion and which determines the physical and chemical properties of the compounds.
The naming of the organic compounds is carried out by following a set of rules laid down by
the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). In IUPAC nomenclature,
the names are correlated with the structure in such a way that the reader can deduce the
structure from the name.
Organic reaction mechanism concepts are based on the structure of the substrate
molecule, fission of a covalent bond, the attacking reagents, the electron displacement effects
and the conditions of the reaction. These organic reactions involve breaking and making
of covalent bonds. A covalent bond may be cleaved in heterolytic or homolytic fashion.
A heterolytic cleavage yields carbocations or carbanions, while a homolytic cleavage gives
free radicals as reactive intermediate. Reactions proceeding through heterolytic cleavage
involve the complimentary pairs of reactive species. These are electron pair donor known as
nucleophile and an electron pair acceptor known as electrophile. The inductive, resonance,
electromeric and hyperconjugation effects may help in the polarisation of a bond making
certain carbon atom or other atom positions as places of low or high electron densities.
Organic reactions can be broadly classified into following types; substitution, addition,
elimination and rearrangement reactions.
Purification, qualitative and quantitative analysis of organic compounds are carried out
for determining their structures. The methods of purification namely : sublimation, distillation
and differential extraction are based on the difference in one or more physical properties.
Chromatography is a useful technique of separation, identification and purification of
compounds. It is classified into two categories : adsorption and partition chromatography.
Adsorption chromatography is based on differential adsorption of various components of a
mixture on an adsorbent. Partition chromatography involves continuous partitioning of the
components of a mixture between stationary and mobile phases. After getting the compound
in a pure form, its qualitative analysis is carried out for detection of elements present in it.
Nitrogen, sulphur, halogens and phosphorus are detected by Lassaigne’s test. Carbon and
hydrogen are estimated by determining the amounts of carbon dioxide and water produced.
Nitrogen is estimated by Dumas or Kjeldahl’s method and halogens by Carius method.
Sulphur and phosphorus are estimated by oxidising them to sulphuric and phosphoric acids
respectively. The percentage of oxygen is usually determined by difference between the total
percentage (100) and the sum of percentages of all other elements present.

The term ‘hydrocarbon’ is self-explanatory which means
compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons
play a key role in our daily life. You must be familiar
with the terms ‘LPG’ and ‘CNG’ used as fuels. LPG is the
abbreviated form of liquified petroleum gas whereas CNG
stands for compressed natural gas. Another term ‘LNG’
(liquified natural gas) is also in news these days. This is
also a fuel and is obtained by liquifaction of natural gas.
Petrol, diesel and kerosene oil are obtained by the fractional
distillation of petroleum found under the earth’s crust.
Coal gas is obtained by the destructive distillation of
coal. Natural gas is found in upper strata during drilling
of oil wells. The gas after compression is known as
compressed natural gas. LPG is used as a domestic fuel
with the least pollution. Kerosene oil is also used as a
domestic fuel but it causes some pollution. Automobiles
need fuels like petrol, diesel and CNG. Petrol and CNG
operated automobiles cause less pollution. All these fuels
contain mixture of hydrocarbons, which are sources of
energy. Hydrocarbons are also used for the manufacture
of polymers like polythene, polypropene, polystyrene etc.
Higher hydrocarbons are used as solvents for paints. They
are also used as the starting materials for manufacture
of many dyes and drugs. Thus, you can well understand
the importance of hydrocarbons in your daily life. In this
unit, you will learn more about hydrocarbons.
9.1	CLASSIFICATION
Hydrocarbons are of different types. Depending upon
the types of carbon-carbon bonds present, they can
be classified into three main categories – (i) saturated



Unit 9.indd 295

296

chemistry

(ii) unsaturated and (iii) aromatic
hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons
contain carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen
single bonds. If different carbon atoms are
joined together to form open chain of carbon
atoms with single bonds, they are termed
as alkanes as you have already studied in
Unit 8. On the other hand, if carbon atoms
form a closed chain or a ring, they are termed
as cycloalkanes. Unsaturated hydrocarbons
contain carbon-carbon multiple bonds –
double bonds, triple bonds or both. Aromatic
hydrocarbons are a special type of cyclic
compounds. You can construct a large
number of models of such molecules of both
types (open chain and close chain) keeping
in mind that carbon is tetravalent and
hydrogen is monovalent. For making models
of alkanes, you can use toothpicks for bonds
and plasticine balls for atoms. For alkenes,
alkynes and aromatic hydrocarbons, spring
models can be constructed.
9.2 ALKANES
As already mentioned, alkanes are saturated
open chain hydr ocarbons containing
carbon - carbon single bonds. Methane (CH4)
is the first member of this family. Methane is
a gas found in coal mines and marshy places.
If you replace one hydrogen atom of methane
by carbon and join the required number of
hydrogens to satisfy the tetravalence of the
other carbon atom, what do you get? You
get C2H6. This hydrocarbon with molecular
formula C2H6 is known as ethane. Thus you
can consider C2H6 as derived from CH4 by
replacing one hydrogen atom by -CH3 group.
Go on constructing alkanes by doing this
theoretical exercise i.e., replacing hydrogen
atom by –CH3 group. The next molecules will
be C3H8, C4H10 …

replace any H by - CH3

These hydrocarbons are inert under
normal conditions as they do not react with
acids, bases and other reagents. Hence,
they were earlier known as paraffins (latin :
parum, little; affinis, affinity). Can you think

of the general formula for alkane family
or homologous series? If we examine the
formula of different alkanes we find that
the general formula for alkanes is CnH2n+2. It
represents any particular homologue when n
is given appropriate value. Can you recall the
structure of methane? According to VSEPR
theory (Unit 4), methane has a tetrahedral
structure (Fig. 9.1), in which carbon atom lies
at the centre and the four hydrogen atoms lie
at the four corners of a regular tetrahedron.
All H-C-H bond angles are of 109.5°.

Fig. 9.1 Structure of methane

In alkanes, tetrahedra are joined together
in which C-C and C-H bond lengths are
154 pm and 112 pm respectively (Unit 8).
You have already read that C–C and C–H σ
bonds are formed by head-on overlapping of
3
sp hybrid orbitals of carbon and 1s orbitals
of hydrogen atoms.
9.2.1 Nomenclature and Isomerism
You have already read about nomenclature
of different classes of organic compounds
in Unit 8. Nomenclature and isomerism
in alkanes can further be understood with
the help of a few more examples. Common
names are given in parenthesis. First three
alkanes – methane, ethane and propane have
only one structure but higher alkanes can
have more than one structure. Let us write
structures for C4H10. Four carbon atoms of
C4H10 can be joined either in a continuous
chain or with a branched chain in the
following two ways :
I

Butane (n- butane), (b.p. 273 K)

isomers. It is also clear that structures I and
III have continuous chain of carbon atoms
but structures II, IV and V have a branched
chain. Such structural isomers which differ
in chain of carbon atoms are known as chain
isomers. Thus, you have seen that C4H10
and C5H12 have two and three chain isomers
respectively.

II

2-Methylpropane (isobutane)
(b.p.261 K)
In how many ways, you can join five
carbon atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms of
C5H12? They can be arranged in three ways
as shown in structures III–V
III

Problem 9.1
Write structures of different chain
isomers of alkanes corresponding to the
molecular formula C6H14. Also write their
IUPAC names.
Solution

2,2-Dimethylpropane (neopentane)
(b.p. 282.5 K)
Structures I and II possess same molecular
formula but differ in their boiling points and
other properties. Similarly structures III, IV
and V possess the same molecular formula
but have different properties. Structures I and
II are isomers of butane, whereas structures
III, IV and V are isomers of pentane. Since
difference in properties is due to difference in
their structures, they are known as structural

Based upon the number of carbon atoms
attached to a carbon atom, the carbon atom is
termed as primary (1°), secondary (2°), tertiary
(3°) or quaternary (4°). Carbon atom attached
to no other carbon atom as in methane or to
only one carbon atom as in ethane is called
primary carbon atom. Terminal carbon
atoms are always primary. Carbon atom
attached to two carbon atoms is known as
secondary. Tertiary carbon is attached to
three carbon atoms and neo or quaternary
carbon is attached to four carbon atoms. Can
you identify 1°, 2°, 3° and 4° carbon atoms in

chemistry

structures I to V ? If you go on constructing
structures for higher alkanes, you will be
getting still larger number of isomers. C6H14
has got five isomers and C7H16 has nine. As
many as 75 isomers are possible for C10H22.
In structures II, IV and V, you observed
that –CH3 group is attached to carbon atom
numbered as 2. You will come across groups
like –CH 3, –C 2H 5, –C 3H 7 etc. attached to
carbon atoms in alkanes or other classes of

compounds. These groups or substituents
are known as alkyl groups as they are derived
from alkanes by removal of one hydrogen
atom. General formula for alkyl groups is
CnH2n+1 (Unit 8).
Let us recall the general rules for
nomenclature already discussed in Unit 8.
Nomenclature of substituted alkanes can
further be understood by considering the
following problem:

Problem 9.2

important to write the correct structure

9.2.2 Preparation
Petroleum and natural gas are the main
sources of alkanes. However, alkanes can be
prepared by following methods :
1. From unsaturated hydrocarbons
Dihydrogen gas adds to alkenes and alkynes
in the presence of finely divided catalysts like
platinum, palladium or nickel to form alkanes.
This process is called hydrogenation. These
metals adsorb dihydrogen gas on their
surfaces and activate the hydrogen – hydrogen
bond. Platinum and palladium catalyse the
reaction at room temperature but relatively
higher temperature and pressure are required
with nickel catalysts.

9.2.3 Properties
Physical properties
Alkanes are almost non-polar molecules
because of the covalent nature of C-C and
C-H bonds and due to very little difference
of electronegativity between carbon and
hydrogen atoms. They possess weak van der
Waals forces. Due to the weak forces, the first
four members, C1 to C4 are gases, C5 to C17
are liquids and those containing 18 carbon
atoms or more are solids at 298 K. They are
colourless and odourless. What do you think
about solubility of alkanes in water based
upon non-polar nature of alkanes? Petrol
is a mixture of hydrocarbons and is used
as a fuel for automobiles. Petrol and lower
fractions of petroleum are also used for dry
cleaning of clothes to remove grease stains.
On the basis of this observation, what do
you think about the nature of the greasy
substance? You are correct if you say that
grease (mixture of higher alkanes) is non-

chemistry

polar and, hence, hydrophobic in nature. It is
generally observed that in relation to solubility
of substances in solvents, polar substances
are soluble in polar solvents, whereas the
non-polar ones in non-polar solvents i.e., like
dissolves like.
Boiling point (b.p.) of different alkanes are
given in Table 9.2 from which it is clear that
there is a steady increase in boiling point with
increase in molecular mass. This is due to the
fact that the intermolecular van der Waals
forces increase with increase of the molecular
size or the surface area of the molecule.
You can make an interesting observation
by having a look on the boiling points of
three isomeric pentanes viz., (pentane,
2-methylbutane and 2,2-dimethylpropane). It
is observed (Table 9.2) that pentane having
a continuous chain of five carbon atoms has
the highest boiling point (309.1K) whereas
2,2 – dimethylpropane boils at 282.5K. With
increase in number of branched chains,
the molecule attains the shape of a sphere.
This results in smaller area of contact and
therefore weak intermolecular forces between
spherical molecules, which are overcome at
relatively lower temperatures.
Chemical properties
As already mentioned, alkanes are generally
inert towards acids, bases, oxidising and

reducing agents. However, they undergo
the following reactions under certain
conditions.
1. Substitution reactions
One or more hydrogen atoms of alkanes
can be replaced by halogens, nitro group
and sulphonic acid group. Halogenation
takes place either at higher temperature
(573-773 K) or in the presence of diffused
sunlight or ultraviolet light. Lower alkanes
do not undergo nitration and sulphonation
reactions. These reactions in which hydrogen
atoms of alkanes are substituted are known
as substitution reactions. As an example,
chlorination of methane is given below:

It is found that the rate of reaction of
alkanes with halogens is F2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2.
Rate of replacement of hydrogens of alkanes is :
3° > 2° > 1°. Fluorination is too violent to
be controlled. Iodination is very slow and a
reversible reaction. It can be carried out in the
presence of oxidizing agents like HIO3 or HNO3.

Halogenation is supposed to proceed via
free radical chain mechanism involving three
steps namely initiation, propagation and
termination as given below:
Mechanism
(i) Initiation : The reaction is initiated
by homolysis of chlorine molecule in the
presence of light or heat. The Cl–Cl bond
is weaker than the C–C and C–H bond and
hence, is easiest to break.

.

(ii) Propagation : Chlorine free radical
attacks the methane molecule and takes the
reaction in the forward direction by breaking
the C-H bond to generate methyl free radical
with the formation of H-Cl.

C  H2C1 + C1– C1 → CH2C12 + C  1
Termination: The reaction stops after
(iii)
some time due to consumption of reactants
and / or due to the following side reactions :
The possible chain terminating steps are:

.

.

(a) C  1 + C  1 → C1–C1

. .
.

(c) H3 C  1 + C  1 → H3C–C1
(b) H3 C   + C   H3 → H3C– CH3

Though in (c), CH3 – Cl, the one of the
products is formed but free radicals are
consumed and the chain is terminated. The
above mechanism helps us to understand
the reason for the formation of ethane as a
byproduct during chlorination of methane.
2. Combustion
Alkanes on heating in the presence of air or
dioxygen are completely oxidized to carbon
dioxide and water with the evolution of large
amount of heat.

CH4 (g) + 202 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O(1);
Äc Hè − 890kJ mol-1
(9.17)

The methyl radical thus obtained attacks
the second molecule of chlorine to form
CH3 – Cl with the liberation of another chlorine
free radical by homolysis of chlorine molecule.
(b) CH3 + C1–C1

steps are possible and may occur. Two such
steps given below explain how more highly
haloginated products are formed.

CH3 – C1 + C1

The chlorine and methyl free radicals
generated above repeat steps (a) and (b)
respectively and thereby setup a chain of
reactions. The propagation steps (a) and
(b) are those which directly give principal
products, but many other propagation

The general combustion equation for any
alkane is :

 3n + 1
CnH2n+2 + 
O → nCO2 + (n + 1)H2O
 2  2

(9.19)
Due to the evolution of large amount of
heat during combustion, alkanes are used as
fuels.
During incomplete combustion of alkanes
with insufficient amount of air or dioxygen,
carbon black is formed which is used in
the manufacture of ink, printer ink, black
pigments and as filters.

n-Alkanes having six or more carbon atoms
on heating to 773K at 10-20 atmospheric

pressure in the presence of oxides of vanadium,
molybdenum or chromium supported over
alumina get dehydrogenated and cyclised to
benzene and its homologues. This reaction is
known as aromatization or reforming.

7. Pyrolysis
Higher alkanes on heating to higher
temperature decompose into lower alkanes,
alkenes etc. Such a decomposition reaction
into smaller fragments by the application of
heat is called pyrolysis or cracking.

(9.28)
Pyrolysis of alkanes is believed to be a
free radical reaction. Preparation of oil gas
or petrol gas from kerosene oil or petrol
involves the principle of pyrolysis. For
example, dodecane, a constituent of kerosene
oil on heating to 973K in the presence of
platinum, palladium or nickel gives a mixture
of heptane and pentene.

9.2.4	Conformations
Alkanes contain carbon-carbon sigma (σ)
bonds. Electron distribution of the sigma
molecular orbital is symmetrical around the
internuclear axis of the C–C bond which is
not disturbed due to rotation about its axis.
This permits free rotation about C–C single
bond. This rotation results into different
spatial arrangements of atoms in space
which can change into one another. Such
spatial arrangements of atoms which can
be converted into one another by rotation
around a C-C single bond are called
conformations or conformers or rotamers.
Alkanes can thus have infinite number of
conformations by rotation around C-C single
bonds. However, it may be remembered that
rotation around a C-C single bond is not
completely free. It is hindered by a small
–1
energy barrier of 1-20 kJ mol due to weak
repulsive interaction between the adjacent
bonds. Such a type of repulsive interaction
is called torsional strain.
Conformations of ethane : Ethane
molecule (C2H6) contains a carbon – carbon
single bond with each carbon atom attached
to three hydrogen atoms. Considering the
ball and stick model of ethane, keep one
carbon atom stationary and rotate the other
carbon atom around the C-C axis. This
rotation results into infinite number of spatial
arrangements of hydrogen atoms attached to
one carbon atom with respect to the hydrogen
atoms attached to the other carbon atom.
These are called conformational isomers
(conformers). Thus there are infinite number
of conformations of ethane. However, there are
two extreme cases. One such conformation
in which hydrogen atoms attached to two
carbons are as closed together as possible is
called eclipsed conformation and the other in
which hydrogens are as far apart as possible
is known as the staggered conformation. Any
other intermediate conformation is called a
skew conformation.It may be remembered
that in all the conformations, the bond angles
and the bond lengths remain the same.
Eclipsed and the staggered conformations can
be represented by Sawhorse and Newman
projections.

1. Sawhorse projections
In this projection, the molecule is viewed
along the molecular axis. It is then projected
on paper by drawing the central C–C bond
as a somewhat longer straight line. Upper
end of the line is slightly tilted towards
right or left hand side. The front carbon is
shown at the lower end of the line, whereas
the rear carbon is shown at the upper end.
Each carbon has three lines attached to it
corresponding to three hydrogen atoms.
The lines are inclined at an angle of 120° to
each other. Sawhorse projections of eclipsed
and staggered conformations of ethane are
depicted in Fig. 9.2.

Fig. 9.2 Sawhorse projections of ethane

2. Newman projections
In this projection, the molecule is viewed at the
C–C bond head on. The carbon atom nearer
to the eye is represented by a point. Three
hydrogen atoms attached to the front carbon
atom are shown by three lines drawn at an
angle of 120° to each other. The rear carbon
atom (the carbon atom away from the eye) is
represented by a circle and the three hydrogen
atoms are shown attached to it by the shorter
lines drawn at an angle of 120° to each other.
The Newman’s projections are depicted in
Fig. 9.3.

chemistry

Relative stability of conformations: As
mentioned earlier, in staggered form of ethane,
the electron clouds of carbon-hydrogen bonds
are as far apart as possible. Thus, there are
minimum repulsive forces, minimum energy
and maximum stability of the molecule. On the
other hand, when the staggered form changes
into the eclipsed form, the electron clouds of the
carbon – hydrogen bonds come closer to each
other resulting in increase in electron cloud
repulsions. To check the increased repulsive
forces, molecule will have to possess more
energy and thus has lesser stability. As already
mentioned, the repulsive interaction between
the electron clouds, which affects stability of
a conformation, is called torsional strain.
Magnitude of torsional strain depends upon
the angle of rotation about C–C bond. This
angle is also called dihedral angle or torsional
angle. Of all the conformations of ethane, the
staggered form has the least torsional strain
and the eclipsed form, the maximum torsional
strain. Therefore, staggered conformation is
more stable than the eclipsed conformation.
Hence, molecule largely remains in staggered
conformation or we can say that it is preferred
conformation. Thus it may be inferred that
rotation around C–C bond in ethane is not
completely free. The energy difference between
the two extreme forms is of the order of 12.5
–1
kJ mol , which is very small. Even at ordinary
temperatures, the ethane molecule gains
thermal or kinetic energy sufficient enough to
–1
overcome this energy barrier of 12.5 kJ mol
through intermolecular collisions. Thus, it
can be said that rotation about carbon-carbon
single bond in ethane is almost free for all
practical purposes. It has not been possible to
separate and isolate different conformational
isomers of ethane.
9.3 Alkenes
Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons
containing at least one double bond. What
should be the general formula of alkenes? If
there is one double bond between two carbon
atoms in alkenes, they must possess two
hydrogen atoms less than alkanes. Hence,
general formula for alkenes is CnH2n. Alkenes
are also known as olefins (oil forming) since

the first member, ethylene or ethene (C2H4)
was found to form an oily liquid on reaction
with chlorine.
9.3.1	Structure of Double Bond
Carbon-carbon double bond in alkenes
consists of one strong sigma (σ) bond (bond
–1
enthalpy about 397 kJ mol ) due to head-on
2
overlapping of sp hybridised orbitals and
one weak pi (π) bond (bond enthalpy about
–1
284 kJ mol ) obtained by lateral or sideways
overlapping of the two 2p orbitals of the two
carbon atoms. The double bond is shorter in
bond length (134 pm) than the C–C single
bond (154 pm). You have already read that
the pi (π) bond is a weaker bond due to poor
sideways overlapping between the two 2p
orbitals. Thus, the presence of the pi (π) bond
makes alkenes behave as sources of loosely
held mobile electrons. Therefore, alkenes are
easily attacked by reagents or compounds
which are in search of electrons. Such
reagents are called electrophilic reagents.
The presence of weaker π-bond makes alkenes
unstable molecules in comparison to alkanes
and thus, alkenes can be changed into single
bond compounds by combining with the
electrophilic reagents. Strength of the double
–1
bond (bond enthalpy, 681 kJ mol ) is greater
than that of a carbon-carbon single bond in
–1
ethane (bond enthalpy, 348 kJ mol ). Orbital
diagrams of ethene molecule are shown in
Figs. 9.4 and 9.5.

9.3.2	Nomenclature
For nomenclature of alkenes in IUPAC system,
the longest chain of carbon atoms containing
the double bond is selected. Numbering of the
chain is done from the end which is nearer to

the double bond. The suffix ‘ene’ replaces ‘ane’
of alkanes. It may be remembered that first
member of alkene series is: CH2 (replacing
n by 1 in CnH2n) known as methene but has
a very short life. As already mentioned, first
stable member of alkene series is C2H4 known
as ethylene (common) or ethene (IUPAC).

9.3.3 Isomerism
Alkenes show both structural isomerism and
geometrical isomerism.
Structural isomerism : As in alkanes, ethene
(C2H4) and propene (C3H6) can have only one
structure but alkenes higher than propene
have different structures. Alkenes possessing
C4H8 as molecular formula can be written in
the following three ways:

Geometrical isomerism: Doubly bonded
carbon atoms have to satisfy the remaining
two valences by joining with two atoms or
groups. If the two atoms or groups attached
to each carbon atom are different, they can
be represented by YX C = C XY like structure.
YX C = C XY can be represented in space in
the following two ways :

In (a), the two identical atoms i.e., both
the X or both the Y lie on the same side
of the double bond but in (b) the two X or
two Y lie across the double bond or on the
opposite sides of the double bond. This
results in different geometry of (a) and (b) i.e.
disposition of atoms or groups in space in
the two arrangements is different. Therefore,
they are stereoisomers. They would have the
same geometry if atoms or groups around
C=C bond can be rotated but rotation around
C=C bond is not free. It is restricted. For
understanding this concept, take two pieces
of strong cardboards and join them with the
help of two nails. Hold one cardboard in your
one hand and try to rotate the other. Can
you really rotate the other cardboard ? The
answer is no. The rotation is restricted. This
illustrates that the restricted rotation of atoms
or groups around the doubly bonded carbon
atoms gives rise to different geometries of
such compounds. The stereoisomers of this
type are called geometrical isomers. The
isomer of the type (a), in which two identical
atoms or groups lie on the same side of the
double bond is called cis isomer and the
other isomer of the type (b), in which identical
atoms or groups lie on the opposite sides of
the double bond is called trans isomer . Thus
cis and trans isomers have the same structure
but have different configuration (arrangement
of atoms or groups in space). Due to different
arrangement of atoms or groups in space,
these isomers differ in their properties like
melting point, boiling point, dipole moment,
solubility etc. Geometrical or cis-trans isomers
of but-2-ene are represented below :

Cis form of alkene is found to be more
polar than the trans form. For example,
dipole moment of cis-but-2-ene is 0.33 Debye,
whereas, dipole moment of the trans form
is almost zero or it can be said that



Unit 9.indd 308

Hydrocarbons

309

trans-but-2-ene is non-polar. This can be
understood by drawing geometries of the two
forms as given below from which it is clear
that in the trans-but-2-ene, the two methyl
groups are in opposite directions, Threfore,
dipole moments of C-CH3 bonds cancel, thus
making the trans form non-polar.

(ii) CH2 = CBr2
(iii) C6H5CH = CH – CH3
(iv) CH3CH = CCl CH3
Solution
(iii) and (iv). In structures (i) and (ii), two
identical groups are attached to one of
the doubly bonded carbon atom.

In the case of solids, it is observed that the
trans isomer has higher melting point than
the cis form.
Geometrical or cis-trans isomerism
is also shown by alkenes of the types
XYC = CXZ and XYC = CZW

Preparation

1. From alkynes: Alkynes on partial
reduction with calculated amount of
dihydrogen in the presence of palladised
charcoal partially deactivated with poisons
like sulphur compounds or quinoline give
alkenes. Partially deactivated palladised
charcoal is known as Lindlar’s catalyst.
Alkenes thus obtained are having cis
geometry. However, alkynes on reduction
with sodium in liquid ammonia form trans
alkenes.

2. From alkyl halides: Alkyl halides (R-X) on
heating with alcoholic potash (potassium
hydroxide dissolved in alcohol, say,

chemistry

ethanol) eliminate one molecule of halogen
acid to form alkenes. This reaction is
known as dehydrohalogenation i.e.,
removal of halogen acid. This is example
of β-elimination reaction, since hydrogen
atom is eliminated from the β carbon atom
(carbon atom next to the carbon to which
halogen is attached).

takes out one hydrogen atom from the
β-carbon atom.

(9.37)
9.3.5

(9.34)
Nature of halogen atom and the alkyl
group determine rate of the reaction. It
is observed that for halogens, the rate is:
iodine > bromine > chlorine, while for alkyl
groups it is : tert > secondary > primary.
3. From vicinal dihalides: Dihalides in
which two halogen atoms are attached
to two adjacent carbon atoms are known
as vicinal dihalides. Vicinal dihalides on
treatment with zinc metal lose a molecule
of ZnX2 to form an alkene. This reaction
is known as dehalogenation.

4. From alcohols by acidic dehydration:
You have read during nomenclature of
different homologous series in Unit 12
that alcohols are the hydroxy derivatives
of alkanes. They are represented by R–OH
where, R is CnH2n+1. Alcohols on heating
with concentrated sulphuric acid form
alkenes with the elimination of one water
molecule. Since a water molecule is
eliminated from the alcohol molecule in
the presence of an acid, this reaction is
known as acidic dehydration of alcohols.
This reaction is also the example of
β-elimination reaction since –OH group

Properties

Physical properties
Alkenes as a class resemble alkanes in
physical properties, except in types of
isomerism and difference in polar nature.
The first three members are gases, the next
fourteen are liquids and the higher ones are
solids. Ethene is a colourless gas with a faint
sweet smell. All other alkenes are colourless
and odourless, insoluble in water but fairly
soluble in non-polar solvents like benzene,
petroleum ether. They show a regular increase
in boiling point with increase in size i.e., every
– CH2 group added increases boiling point by
20–30 K. Like alkanes, straight chain alkenes
have higher boiling point than isomeric
branched chain compounds.
Chemical properties
Alkenes are the rich source of loosely held
pi (π) electrons, due to which they show
addition reactions in which the electrophiles
add on to the carbon-carbon double bond to
form the addition products. Some reagents
also add by free radical mechanism. There
are cases when under special conditions,
alkenes also undergo free radical substitution
reactions. Oxidation and ozonolysis reactions
are also quite prominent in alkenes. A brief
description of different reactions of alkenes
is given below:
1. Addition of dihydrogen: Alkenes add
up one molecule of dihydrogen gas in
the presence of finely divided nickel,
palladium or platinum to form alkanes
(Section 9.2.2)
2. Addition of halogens : Halogens like
bromine or chlorine add up to alkene to
form vicinal dihalides. However, iodine
does not show addition reaction under

normal conditions. The reddish orange
colour of bromine solution in carbon
tetrachloride is discharged when bromine
adds up to an unsaturation site. This
reaction is used as a test for unsaturation.
Addition of halogens to alkenes is an
example of electrophilic addition reaction
involving cyclic halonium ion formation
which you will study in higher classes.

(9.38)

(9.39)
3. Addition of hydrogen halides: Hydrogen
halides (HCl, HBr,HI) add up to alkenes
to for m alkyl halides. The order of
reactivity of the hydrogen halides is
HI > HBr > HCl. Like addition of halogens
to alkenes, addition of hydrogen halides is
also an example of electrophilic addition
reaction. Let us illustrate this by taking
addition of HBr to symmetrical and
unsymmetrical alkenes
Addition reaction of HBr to symmetrical
alkenes
Addition reactions of HBr to symmetrical
alkenes (similar groups attached to double
bond) take place by electrophilic addition
mechanism.

Markovnikov, a Russian chemist made a
generalisation in 1869 after studying such
reactions in detail. These generalisations
led Markovnikov to frame a rule called
Markovnikov rule. The rule states that
negative part of the addendum (adding
molecule) gets attached to that carbon atom
which possesses lesser number of hydrogen
atoms. Thus according to this rule, product
I i.e., 2-bromopropane is expected. In actual
practice, this is the principal product of the
reaction. This generalisation of Markovnikov
rule can be better understood in terms of
mechanism of the reaction.
Mechanism
Hydrogen bromide provides an electrophile,
+
H , which attacks the double bond to form
carbocation as shown below :

(a) less stable
(b) more stable
primary carbocation secondary carbocation
(i) The secondary carbocation (b) is more
stable than the primary carbocation
(a), therefore, the former predominates
because it is formed at a faster rate.
–
(ii) The carbocation (b) is attacked by Br ion
to form the product as follows :

Anti Markovnikov addition or peroxide
effect or Kharash effect
In the presence of peroxide, addition of HBr
to unsymmetrical alkenes like propene takes
place contrary to the Markovnikov rule. This
happens only with HBr but not with HCl
and Hl. This addition reaction was observed
by M.S. Kharash and F.R. Mayo in 1933
at the University of Chicago. This reaction
is known as peroxide or Kharash effect
or addition reaction anti to Markovnikov
rule.

Mechanism : Peroxide effect proceeds via

The secondary free radical obtained in the
above mechanism (step iii) is more stable than
the primary. This explains the formation of
1-bromopropane as the major product. It may
be noted that the peroxide effect is not observed
in addition of HCl and HI. This may be due
to the fact that the H–Cl bond being
–1
stronger (430.5 kJ mol ) than H–Br bond
–1
(363.7 kJ mol ), is not cleaved by the free
radical, whereas the H–I bond is weaker
–1
(296.8 kJ mol ) and iodine free radicals
combine to form iodine molecules instead of
adding to the double bond.

bond in alkenes or other unsaturated
compounds.

Polythene is obtained by the combination
of large number of ethene molecules at
high temperature, high pressure and
in the presence of a catalyst. The large
molecules thus obtained are called
polymers. This reaction is known as
polymerisation. The simple compounds
from which polymers are made are called

Polymers are used for the manufacture of plastic

is used for the manufacture of milk crates,
plastic buckets and other moulded articles.
Though these materials have now become
common, excessive use of polythene and
polypropylene is a matter of great concern for
all of us.
9.4 Alkynes
Like alkenes, alkynes are also unsaturated
hydrocarbons. They contain at least one triple
bond between two carbon atoms. The number
of hydrogen atoms is still less in alkynes as
compared to alkenes or alkanes. Their general
formula is CnH2n–2.
The first stable member of alkyne series
is ethyne which is popularly known as
acetylene. Acetylene is used for arc welding
purposes in the form of oxyacetylene flame
obtained by mixing acetylene with oxygen
gas. Alkynes are starting materials for a large
number of organic compounds. Hence, it
is interesting to study this class of organic
compounds.
9.4.1	Nomenclature and Isomerism
In common system, alkynes are named as
derivatives of acetylene. In IUPAC system, they

are named as derivatives of the corresponding
alkanes replacing ‘ane’ by the suffix ‘yne’.
The position of the triple bond is indicated
by the first triply bonded carbon. Common
and IUPAC names of a few members of alkyne
series are given in Table 9.2.
You have already learnt that ethyne and
propyne have got only one structure but
there are two possible structures for butyne –
(i) but-1-yne and (ii) but-2-yne. Since these
two compounds differ in their structures
due to the position of the triple bond, they
are known as position isomers. In how
many ways, you can construct the structure

9.4.2 Structure of Triple Bond
Ethyne is the simplest molecule of alkyne
series. Structure of ethyne is shown in
Fig. 9.6.
Each carbon atom of ethyne has two sp
hybridised orbitals. Carbon-carbon sigma (σ)
bond is obtained by the head-on overlapping
of the two sp hybridised orbitals of the two
carbon atoms. The remaining sp hybridised
orbital of each carbon atom undergoes
overlapping along the internuclear axis with
the 1s orbital of each of the two hydrogen
atoms for ming two C-H sigma bonds.
H-C-C bond angle is of 180°. Each carbon
has two unhybridised p orbitals which are
perpendicular to each other as well as to the
plane of the C-C sigma bond. The 2p orbitals
of one carbon atom are parallel to the 2p

Orbital picture of ethyne showing
(a) sigma overlaps (b) pi overlaps.

orbitals of the other carbon atom, which
undergo lateral or sideways overlapping to
form two pi (π) bonds between two carbon
atoms. Thus ethyne molecule consists of one
C–C σ bond, two C–H σ bonds and two C–C
π bonds. The strength of C≡C bond (bond
-1
enthalpy 823 kJ mol ) is more than those
–1
of C=C bond (bond enthalpy 681 kJ mol )
–1
and C–C bond (bond enthalpy 348 kJ mol ).
The C≡C bond length is shorter (120 pm)
than those of C=C (133 pm) and C–C (154
pm). Electron cloud between two carbon
atoms is cylindrically symmetrical about the
internuclear axis. Thus, ethyne is a linear
molecule.
9.4.3

Preparation

1. From calcium carbide: On industrial
scale, ethyne is prepared by treating
calcium carbide with water. Calcium
carbide is prepared by heating quick lime
with coke. Quick lime can be obtained by

9.4.4

Properties

Physical properties
Physical properties of alkynes follow the same
trend of alkenes and alkanes. First three
members are gases, the next eight are liquids
and the higher ones are solids. All alkynes
are colourless. Ethyene has characteristic
odour. Other members are odourless. Alkynes
are weakly polar in nature. They are lighter
than water and immiscible with water but
soluble in organic solvents like ethers, carbon
tetrachloride and benzene. Their melting
point, boiling point and density increase with
increase in molar mass.
Chemical properties
Alkynes show acidic nature, addition reactions
and polymerisation reactions as follows :
A. Acidic character of alkyne: Sodium
metal and sodamide (NaNH 2) are strong
bases. They react with ethyne to form sodium
acetylide with the liberation of dihydrogen
gas. These reactions have not been observed
in case of ethene and ethane thus indicating
that ethyne is acidic in nature in comparison
to ethene and ethane. Why is it so ? Has
it something to do with their structures
and the hybridisation ? You have read that
hydrogen atoms in ethyne are attached to

the sp hybridised carbon atoms whereas
2
they are attached to sp hybridised carbon
3
atoms in ethene and sp hybridised carbons
in ethane. Due to the maximum percentage of
s character (50%), the sp hybridised orbitals
of carbon atoms in ethyne molecules have
highest electronegativity; hence, these attract
the shared electron pair of the C-H bond of
ethyne to a greater extent than that of the
2
sp hybridised orbitals of carbon in ethene
3
and the sp hybridised orbital of carbon in
ethane. Thus in ethyne, hydrogen atoms
can be liberated as protons more easily as
compared to ethene and ethane. Hence,
hydrogen atoms of ethyne attached to triply
bonded carbon atom are acidic in nature. You
may note that the hydrogen atoms attached
to the triply bonded carbons are acidic but
not all the hydrogen atoms of alkynes.

about the above reactions with but-1-yne and

follow the following trend in their acidic
behaviour :
i)

CH ≡ CH > H2C – CH2 > CH3 –CH3

ii) HC ≡ CH > CH3 –C≡ CH >> CH3 –C≡C–CH3
B. Addition reactions: Alkynes contain a
triple bond, so they add up, two molecules of
dihydrogen, halogen, hydrogen halides etc.
Formation of the addition product takes place
according to the following steps.

The addition product formed depends
upon stability of vinylic cation. Addition in
unsymmetrical alkynes takes place according
to Markovnikov rule. Majority of the reactions
of alkynes are the examples of electrophilic
addition reactions. A few addition reactions
are given below:

However, one molecule of water adds to
alkynes on warming with mercuric sulphate
and dilute sulphuric acid at 333 K to form
carbonyl compounds.

(v) Polymerisation
(a) Linear polymerisation: Under suitable
conditions, linear polymerisation of ethyne
takes place to produce polyacetylene or
polyethyne which is a high molecular
weight polyene containing repeating units of
(CH = CH – CH = CH ) and can be represented
as —( CH = CH – CH = CH )n— Under special
conditions, this polymer conducts electricity.

chemistry

Thin film of polyacetylene can be used as
electrodes in batteries. These films are good
conductors, lighter and cheaper than the
metal conductors.
(b) Cyclic polymerisation: Ethyne on
passing through red hot iron tube at 873K
undergoes cyclic polymerization. Three
molecules polymerise to form benzene, which
is the starting molecule for the preparation of
derivatives of benzene, dyes, drugs and large
number of other organic compounds. This is
the best route for entering from aliphatic to
aromatic compounds as discussed below:

but in a majority of reactions of aromatic
compounds, the unsaturation of benzene ring
is retained. However, there are examples of
aromatic hydrocarbons which do not contain a
benzene ring but instead contain other highly
unsaturated ring. Aromatic compounds
containing benzene ring are known as
benzenoids and those not containing a
benzene ring are known as non-benzenoids.
Some examples of arenes are given
below:

odour (Greek; aroma meaning pleasant

named as ‘aromatic compounds’. Most of such

ring. Benzene ring is highly unsaturated

9.5.1 Nomenclature and Isomerism
The nomenclature and isomerism of aromatic
hydrocarbons has already been discussed in
Unit 8. All six hydrogen atoms in benzene
are equivalent; so it forms one and only one
type of monosubstituted product. When two
hydrogen atoms in benzene are replaced by
two similar or different monovalent atoms or
groups, three different position isomers are
possible. The 1, 2 or 1, 6 is known as the ortho
(o–), the 1, 3 or 1, 5 as meta (m–) and the 1,
4 as para (p–) disubstituted compounds. A
few examples of derivatives of benzene are
given below:

Friedrich August Kekulé,a German chemist was born in 1829 at Darmsdt in
Germany. He became Professor in 1856 and Fellow of Royal Society in 1875. He
made major contribution to structural organic chemistry by proposing in 1858 that
carbon atoms can join to one another to form chains and later in 1865,he found
an answer to the challenging problem of benzene structure by suggesting that
these chains can close to form rings. He gave the dynamic structural formula to
benzene which forms the basis for its modern electronic structure. He described
the discovery of benzene structure later as:
“I was sitting writing at my textbook,but the work did not progress; my thoughts
were elsewhere. I turned my chair to the fire, and dozed. Again the atoms were
gambolling before my eyes. This time the smaller groups kept modestly in the
background. My mental eye, rendered more acute by repeated visions of this
kind, could now distinguish larger structures of manifold conformations; long

rows,sometimes more closely fitted together; all twisting and turning in snake like motion. But look! What
was that? One of the snakes had seized hold of it’s own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my
eyes. As if by a flash of lightning I woke;.... I spent the rest of the night working out the consequences of
the hypothesis. Let us learn to dream, gentlemen, and then perhaps we shall learn the truth but let us
beware of making our dreams public before they have been approved by the waking mind.”( 1890).
One hundred years later, on the occasion of Kekulé’s centenary celebrations a group of compounds
having polybenzenoid structures have been named as Kekulenes.

1,3 Dimethylbenzene 1,4-Dimethylbenzene
(m-Xylene)		
( p-Xylene)

was further found to produce one and only one
monosubstituted derivative which indicated
that all the six carbon and six hydrogen atoms
of benzene are identical. On the basis of this
observation August Kekulé in 1865 proposed
the following structure for benzene having
cyclic arrangement of six carbon atoms with
alternate single and double bonds and one
hydrogen atom attached to each carbon atom.

9.5.2 Structure of Benzene
Benzene was isolated by Michael Faraday
in 1825. The molecular formula of benzene,
C6H6, indicates a high degree of unsaturation.
This molecular formula did not account for
its relationship to corresponding alkanes,
alkenes and alkynes which you have studied
in earlier sections of this unit. What do you
think about its possible structure? Due to
its unique properties and unusual stability,
it took several years to assign its structure.
Benzene was found to be a stable molecule
and found to form a triozonide which indicates
the presence of three double bonds. Benzene

The Kekulé structure indicates
the possibility of two isomeric
1, 2-dibromobenzenes. In one of the isomers,
the bromine atoms are attached to the
doubly bonded carbon atoms whereas in the
other, they are attached to the singly bonded
carbons.

chemistry

unhybridised p orbital perpendicular to the
plane of the ring as shown below:

However, benzene was found to form only
one ortho disubstituted product. This problem
was overcome by Kekulé by suggesting the
concept of oscillating nature of double bonds
in benzene as given below.

Even with this modification, Kekulé
structure of benzene fails to explain unusual
stability and preference to substitution
reactions than addition reactions, which
could later on be explained by resonance.

The unhybridised p orbital of carbon atoms
are close enough to form a π bond by lateral
overlap. There are two equal possibilities of
forming three π bonds by overlap of p orbitals
of C1 –C2, C3 – C4, C5 – C6 or C2 – C3, C4 – C5,
C6 – C1 respectively as shown in the following
figures.

Resonance and stability of benzene
According to Valence Bond Theory, the
concept of oscillating double bonds in benzene
is now explained by resonance. Benzene is a
hybrid of various resonating structures. The
two structures, A and B given by Kekulé are
the main contributing structures. The hybrid
structure is represented by inserting a circle
or a dotted circle in the hexagon as shown
in (C). The circle represents the six electrons
which are delocalised between the six carbon
atoms of the benzene ring.

(A)		
(B)
(C)
The orbital overlapping gives us better
picture about the structure of benzene. All
2
the six carbon atoms in benzene are sp
2
hybridized. Two sp hybrid orbitals of each
2
carbon atom overlap with sp hybrid orbitals
of adjacent carbon atoms to form six C—C
sigma bonds which are in the hexagonal
2
plane. The remaining sp hybrid orbital of
each carbon atom overlaps with s orbital
of a hydrogen atom to form six C—H sigma
bonds. Each carbon atom is now left with one

Structures shown in Fig. 9.7(a) and (b)

between all the carbon atoms in the ring has
been determined by the X-ray diffraction to
be the same; there is equal probability for the
p orbital of each carbon atom to overlap with
the p orbitals of adjacent carbon atoms [Fig.
9.7 (c)]. This can be represented in the form
of two doughtnuts (rings) of electron clouds
[Fig. 9.7 (d)], one above and one below the
plane of the hexagonal ring as shown below:

(i) Planarity
(ii) Complete delocalisation of the π electrons
in the ring
(iii) Presence of (4n + 2) π electrons in the ring
where n is an integer (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .).
This is often referred to as Hückel Rule.
Some examples of aromatic compounds are
given below:

(electron cloud)
Fig. 9.7 (c)

Fig. 9.7 (d)

The six π electrons are thus delocalised
and can move freely about the six carbon
nuclei, instead of any two as shown in
Fig. 9.6 (a) or (b). The delocalised π electron cloud
is attracted more strongly by the nuclei of the
carbon atoms than the electron cloud localised
between two carbon atoms. Therefore, presence
of delocalised π electrons in benzene makes
it more stable than the hypothetical
cyclohexatriene.
X-Ray diffraction data reveals that benzene
is a planar molecule. Had any one of the above
structures of benzene (A or B) been correct,
two types of C—C bond lengths were expected.
However, X-ray data indicates that all the
six C—C bond lengths are of the same order
(139 pm) which is intermediate between
C— C single bond (154 pm) and C—C double
bond (133 pm). Thus the absence of pure
double bond in benzene accounts for the
reluctance of benzene to show addition
reactions under normal conditions, thus
explaining the unusual behaviour of benzene.

9.5.4 Preparation of Benzene
Benzene is commercially isolated from coal
tar. However, it may be prepared in the
laboratory by the following methods.
(i) Cyclic polymerisation of ethyne:
(Section 9.4.4)
(ii) Decarboxylation of aromatic acids:
Sodium salt of benzoic acid on heating
with sodalime gives benzene.

9.5.3 Aromaticity
Benzene was considered as parent ‘aromatic’
compound. Now, the name is applied to all the
ring systems whether or not having benzene
ring, possessing following characteristics.

to benzene by passing its vapours over
heated zinc dust

(ii) Halogenation: Arenes react with halogens

FeCl3, FeBr3 or AlCl3 to yield haloarenes.

(iii) Sulphonation: The replacement of a
hydrogen atom by a sulphonic acid group in
a ring is called sulphonation. It is carried out
by heating benzene with fuming sulphuric
acid (oleum).

9.5.5 Properties
Physical properties
Aromatic hydrocarbons are non- polar
molecules and are usually colourless liquids
or solids with a characteristic aroma. You are
also familiar with naphthalene balls which are
used in toilets and for preservation of clothes
because of unique smell of the compound
and the moth repellent property. Aromatic
hydrocarbons are immiscible with water but
are readily miscible with organic solvents.
They burn with sooty flame.
Chemical properties
Arenes are characterised by electrophilic
substitution reactions. However, under
special conditions they can also undergo
addition and oxidation reactions.
Electrophilic substitution reactions
The common electrophilic substitution
reactions of arenes are nitration, halogenation,
sulphonation, Friedel Craft’s alkylation and
acylation reactions in which attacking reagent
+
is an electrophile (E )
(i) Nitration: A nitro group is introduced
into benzene ring when benzene is heated
with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid
and concentrated sulphuric acid (nitrating
mixture).

(9.74)
(iv) Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction:
When benzene is treated with an alkyl halide
in the presence of anhydrous aluminium
chloride, alkylbenene is formed.

treating benzene with 1-chloropropane
instead of n-propyl benzene?

(v) Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction: The
reaction of benzene with an acyl halide or
acid anhydride in the presence of Lewis acids
(AlCl3) yields acyl benzene.

If excess of electrophilic reagent is used,
further substitution reaction may take place
in which other hydrogen atoms of benzene
ring may also be successively replaced
by the electrophile. For example, benzene
on treatment with excess of chlorine in
the presence of anhydrous AlCl 3 can be
chlorinated to hexachlorobenzene (C6Cl6)

(9.79)
		
Mechanism of electrophilic substitution
reactions:
According to experimental evidences, SE (S =
substitution; E = electrophilic) reactions are
supposed to proceed via the following three
steps:
(a) Generation of the eletrophile
(b) Formation of carbocation intermediate
(c) Removal of proton from the carbocation
intermediate

It is interesting to note that in the process
of generation of nitronium ion, sulphuric acid
serves as an acid and nitric acid as a base.
Thus, it is a simple acid-base equilibrium.

results in the formation of σ-complex or

Sigma complex or arenium ion loses its
aromatic character because delocalisation of

electrons stops at sp hybridised carbon.
(c) Removal of proton: To restore the
aromatic character, σ -complex releases

temperature and/ or pressure in the presence
of nickel catalyst, hydrogenation of benzene
gives cyclohexane.

9.5.6	Directive influence of a functional
group in monosubstituted benzene
When monosubstituted benzene is subjected
to further substitution, three possible
disubstituted products are not formed in
equal amounts. Two types of behaviour are
observed. Either ortho and para products or
meta product is predominantly formed. It
has also been observed that this behaviour
depends on the nature of the substituent
already present in the benzene ring and not
on the nature of the entering group. This is
known as directive influence of substituents.
Reasons for ortho/para or meta directive
nature of groups are discussed below:
Ortho and para directing groups: The
groups which direct the incoming group to
ortho and para positions are called ortho and
para directing groups. As an example, let us
discuss the directive influence of phenolic
(–OH) group. Phenol is resonance hybrid of
following structures:

It is clear from the above resonating
structures that the electron density is more on
o – and p – positions. Hence, the substitution
takes place mainly at these positions. However,
it may be noted that –I effect of – OH group also
operates due to which the electron density on
ortho and para positions of the benzene ring
is slightly reduced. But the overall electron
density increases at these positions of the
ring due to resonance. Therefore, –OH group
activates the benzene ring for the attack by



Unit 9.indd 324

Hydrocarbons

325

an electrophile. Other examples of activating
groups are –NH2, –NHR, –NHCOCH3, –OCH3,
–CH3, –C2H5, etc.
In the case of aryl halides, halogens are
moderately deactivating. Because of their
strong – I effect, overall electron density on
benzene ring decreases. It makes further
substitution difficult. However, due to
resonance the electron density on o– and
p – positions is greater than that at the
m-position. Hence, they are also o – and p –
directing groups. Resonance structures of
chlorobenzene are given below:

In this case, the overall electron density
on benzene ring decreases making further
substitution difficult, therefore these groups
are also called ‘deactivating groups’. The
electron density on o – and p – position
is comparatively less than that at meta
position. Hence, the electrophile attacks on
comparatively electron rich meta position
resulting in meta substitution.
9.6 Carcinogenicity and Toxicity
Benzene and polynuclear hydrocarbons
containing more than two benzene rings
fused together are toxic and said to
possess cancer producing (carcinogenic)
property. Such polynuclear hydrocarbons
are formed on incomplete combustion of
organic materials like tobacco, coal and
petroleum. They enter into human body
and undergo various biochemical reactions
and finally damage DNA and cause cancer.
Some of the carcinogenic hydrocarbons are
given below (see box).

Meta directing group: The groups which
direct the incoming group to meta position are
called meta directing groups. Some examples
of meta directing groups are –NO2, –CN, –CHO,
–COR, –COOH, –COOR, –SO3H, etc.
Let us take the example of nitro group.
Nitro group reduces the electron density in
the benzene ring due to its strong–I effect.
Nitrobenzene is a resonance hybrid of the
following structures.

SUMMARY
Hydrocarbons are the compounds of carbon and hydrogen only. Hydrocarbons are mainly
obtained from coal and petroleum, which are the major sources of energy. Petrochemicals
are the prominent starting materials used for the manufacture of a large number of
commercially important products. LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) and CNG (compressed
natural gas), the main sources of energy for domestic fuels and the automobile industry, are
obtained from petroleum. Hydrocarbons are classified as open chain saturated (alkanes)
and unsaturated (alkenes and alkynes), cyclic (alicyclic) and aromatic, according to their
structure.
The important reactions of alkanes are free radical substitution, combustion, oxidation
and aromatization. Alkenes and alkynes undergo addition reactions, which are mainly
electrophilic additions. Aromatic hydrocarbons, despite having unsaturation, undergo
mainly electrophilic substitution reactions. These undergo addition reactions only under
special conditions.
Alkanes show conformational isomerism due to free rotation along the C–C sigma
bonds. Out of staggered and the eclipsed conformations of ethane, staggered conformation
is more stable as hydrogen atoms are farthest apart. Alkenes exhibit geometrical
(cis-trans) isomerism due to restricted rotation around the carbon–carbon double bond.
Benzene and benzenoid compounds show aromatic character. Aromaticity, the
property of being aromatic is possessed by compounds having specific electronic structure
characterised by Hückel (4n+2)π electron rule. The nature of groups or substituents attached
to benzene ring is responsible for activation or deactivation of the benzene ring towards
further electrophilic substitution and also for orientation of the incoming group. Some of
the polynuclear hydrocarbons having fused benzene ring system have carcinogenic property.

Appendix I

Definitions of the SI Base Units

Metre (m): The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed
numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458 when expressed in
the unit ms-1, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency.
Kilogram (k): The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the planck constant h to be 6.62607015 ×10–34 when expressed
in the unit Js, which is equal to kgm2s-1, where the metre and the second are defined
in terms of c and Vcs.
Second (s): The symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical
value of the caesium frequency Vcs, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition
frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz,
which is equal to s–1.
Ampere (A): The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by
taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be 1.602176634×10–19 when
expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms of.
Kelvin (K): The Kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It
is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant K to be
1.380649×10–23 when expressed in the unit JK–1, which is equal to kgm2s–2K–1, where
the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and Vcs.
Mole (mol): The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole
contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the fixed
numerical value of the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the unit mol–1 and
is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance, symbol n, of a system is a
measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an
atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles.
Candela (cd): The candela, symbol cd is the SI unit of luminous intensity in a given
direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of
monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 Hz, Kcd, to be 683 when expressed
in the unit lm·W–1, which is equal to cd·sr·W–1, or cd sr kg–1m–2s3, where the kilogram,
metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and Vcs.
(The symbols listed here are internationally agreed and should not be changed in other
languages and scripts.

= 14.70 pounds per square inch
1 bar = 105 pascals
1 torr = 1 millimetre of mercury
1 pascal = 1 kg/ms2 = 1 N/m2
Temperature
SI Base Unit: Kelvin (K)
K = -273.15°C
K = °C + 273.15
°
F = 1.8(°C) + 32

* Force: 1 newton (N) = 1 kg m/s2, i.e., the force that, when applied for 1 second, gives a
1-kilogram mass a velocity of 1 metre per second.
** The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water from 14.50C to
15.50C.
† Note that the other units are per particle and must be multiplied by 6.022 ×1023 to be strictly
comparable.

*The entropies of individual ions in solution are determined by setting the entropy of H+ in water equal to
0 and then defining the entropies of all other ions relative to this value; hence a negative entropy is one
that is lower than the entropy of H+ in water.

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s
life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks
a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our
system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi
and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this
basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of
sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will
take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education
outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,
time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information
passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning
are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the
annual calender so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted
to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address
the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at
different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher
priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion
in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this
book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and
mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor B.
L. Khandelwal for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed
to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making
this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have
generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. As
an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the
quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will
enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

Rationalisation of Content in the Textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce
content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also
emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities
for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background,
the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks
across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the
NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this
exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the
following:
• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas
in the same class
• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same
subject
• Difficulty level
• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through
self-learning or peer-learning
• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes
given above.

Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry

After studying this unit, you will be
able to
• appreciate the contribution of India
in the development of chemistry
understand the role of chemistry
in different spheres of life;
• explain the characteristics of three
states of matter;
• classify different substances
into elements, compounds and
mixtures;
• use scientific notations and
determine significant figures;
• differentiate between precision and
accuracy;
• define SI base units and convert
physical quantities from one
system of units to another;
• explain various laws of chemical
combination;
• appreciate significance of atomic
mass, average atomic mass,
molecular mass and formula mass;
• describe the terms – mole and
molar mass;
• calculate the mass per cent of
component elements constituting
a compound;
• determine empirical formula and
molecular formula for a compound
from the given experimental data;
and
• perform the stoichiometric
calculations.

Chemistry is the science of molecules and their
transformations. It is the science not so much of the one
hundred elements but of the infinite variety of molecules
that may be built from them.
Roald Hoffmann

Science can be viewed as a continuing human effort to
systematise knowledge for describing and understanding
nature. You have learnt in your previous classes that we
come across diverse substances present in nature and
changes in them in daily life. Curd formation from milk,
formation of vinegar from sugarcane juice on keeping
for prolonged time and rusting of iron are some of the
examples of changes which we come across many times.
For the sake of convenience, science is sub-divided into
various disciplines: chemistry, physics, biology, geology,
etc. The branch of science that studies the preparation,
properties, structure and reactions of material substances
is called chemistry.
Development of chemistry
Chemistry, as we understand it today, is not a very old
discipline. Chemistry was not studied for its own sake, rather
it came up as a result of search for two interesting things:
i. Philosopher’s stone (Paras) which would convert
all baser metals e.g., iron and copper into gold.
ii. ‘Elexir of life’ which would grant immortality.
People in ancient India, already had the knowledge of
many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of
modern science. They applied that knowledge in various
walks of life. Chemistry developed mainly in the form
of Alchemy and Iatrochemistry during 1300-1600 CE.
Modern chemistry took shape in the 18th century Europe,
after a few centuries of alchemical traditions which were
introduced in Europe by the Arabs.

chemistry

Other cultures – especially the Chinese
and the Indian – had their own alchemical
traditions. These included much knowledge of
chemical processes and techniques.
In ancient India, chemistry was called
Rasayan Shastra, Rastantra, Ras Kriya or
Rasvidya. It included metallurgy, medicine,
manufacture of cosmetics, glass, dyes, etc.
Systematic excavations at Mohenjodaro in
Sindh and Harappa in Punjab prove that the
story of development of chemistry in India
is very old. Archaeological findings show
that baked bricks were used in construction
work. It shows the mass production of
pottery, which can be regarded as the earliest
chemical process, in which materials were
mixed, moulded and subjected to heat by
using fire to achieve desirable qualities.
Remains of glazed pottery have been found in
Mohenjodaro. Gypsum cement has been used
in the construction work. It contains lime,
sand and traces of CaCO3. Harappans made
faience, a sort of glass which was used in
ornaments. They melted and forged a variety
of objects from metals, such as lead, silver,
gold and copper. They improved the hardness
of copper for making artefacts by using tin
and arsenic. A number of glass objects were
found in Maski in South India (1000–900
BCE), and Hastinapur and Taxila in North
India (1000–200 BCE). Glass and glazes were
coloured by addition of colouring agents like
metal oxides.
Copper metallurgy in India dates back to
the beginning of chalcolithic cultures in the
subcontinent. There are much archeological
evidences to support the view that technologies
for extraction of copper and iron were
developed indigenously.
According to Rigveda, tanning of leather
and dying of cotton were practised during
1000–400 BCE. The golden gloss of the
black polished ware of northen India could
not be replicated and is still a chemical
mystery. These wares indicate the mastery
with which kiln temperatures could be
controlled. Kautilya’s Arthashastra describes
the production of salt from sea.
A vast number of statements and material
described in the ancient Vedic literature can

be shown to agree with modern scientific
findings. Copper utensils, iron, gold, silver
ornaments and terracotta discs and painted
grey pottery have been found in many
archaeological sites in north India. Sushruta
Samhita explains the importance of Alkalies.
The Charaka Samhita mentions ancient
indians who knew how to prepare sulphuric
acid, nitric acid and oxides of copper, tin and
zinc; the sulphates of copper, zinc and iron
and the carbonates of lead and iron.
Rasopanishada describes the preparation
of gunpowder mixture. Tamil texts also
describe the preparation of fireworks using
sulphur, charcoal, saltpetre (i.e., potassium
nitrate), mercury, camphor, etc.
Nagarjuna was a great Indian scientist. He
was a reputed chemist, an alchemist and a
metallurgist. His work Rasratnakar deals with
the formulation of mercury compounds. He
has also discussed methods for the extraction
of metals, like gold, silver, tin and copper. A
book, Rsarnavam, appeared around 800 CE.
It discusses the uses of various furnaces,
ovens and crucibles for different purposes. It
describes methods by which metals could be
identified by flame colour.
Chakrapani discovered mercury sulphide.
The credit for inventing soap also goes to him.
He used mustard oil and some alkalies as
ingredients for making soap. Indians began
making soaps in the 18th century CE. Oil of
Eranda and seeds of Mahua plant and calcium
carbonate were used for making soap.
The paintings found on the walls of Ajanta
and Ellora, which look fresh even after ages,
testify to a high level of science achieved in
ancient India. Varähmihir’s Brihat Samhita is
a sort of encyclopaedia, which was composed
in the sixth century CE. It informs about the
preparation of glutinous material to be applied
on walls and roofs of houses and temples. It
was prepared entirely from extracts of various
plants, fruits, seeds and barks, which were
concentrated by boiling, and then, treated
with various resins. It will be interesting to
test such materials scientifically and assess
them for use.

A number of classical texts, like
Atharvaveda (1000 BCE) mention some
dye stuff, the material used were turmeric,
madder, sunflower, orpiment, cochineal and
lac. Some other substances having tinting
property were kamplcica, pattanga and jatuka.
Varähmihir’s Brihat Samhita gives
references to perfumes and cosmetics.
Recipes for hair dying were made from plants,
like indigo and minerals like iron power,
black iron or steel and acidic extracts of sour
rice gruel. Gandhayukli describes recipes
for making scents, mouth perfumes, bath
powders, incense and talcum power.
Paper was known to India in the 17
century as account of Chinese traveller I-tsing
describes. Excavations at Taxila indicate that
ink was used in India from the fourth century.
Colours of ink were made from chalk, red lead
and minimum.

th

It seems that the process of fermentation
was well-known to Indians. Vedas and
Kautilya’s Arthashastra mention about
many types of liquors. Charaka Samhita also
mentions ingredients, such as barks of plants,
stem, flowers, leaves, woods, cereals, fruits
and sugarcane for making Asavas.
The concept that matter is ultimately
made of indivisible building blocks, appeared
in India a few centuries BCE as a part of
philosophical speculations. Acharya Kanda,
born in 600 BCE, originally known by the
name Kashyap, was the first proponent
of the ‘atomic theory’. He formulated the
theory of very small indivisible particles,
which he named ‘Paramãnu’ (comparable
to atoms). He authored the text Vaiseshika
Sutras. According to him, all substances are
aggregated form of smaller units called atoms
(Paramãnu), which are eternal, indestructible,
spherical, suprasensible and in motion in
the original state. He explained that this
individual entity cannot be sensed through
any human organ. Kanda added that there
are varieties of atoms that are as different as
the different classes of substances. He said
these (Paramãnu) could form pairs or triplets,
among other combinations and unseen

forces cause interaction between them. He
conceptualised this theory around 2500 years
before John Dalton (1766-1844).
Charaka Samhita is the oldest Ayurvedic
epic of India. It describes the treatment of
diseases. The concept of reduction of particle
size of metals is clearly discussed in Charaka
Samhita. Extreme reduction of particle size is
termed as nanotechnology. Charaka Samhita
describes the use of bhasma of metals in the
treatment of ailments. Now-a-days, it has
been proved that bhasmas have nanoparticles
of metals.
After the decline of alchemy, Iatrochemistry
reached a steady state, but it too declined due
to the introduction and practise of western
medicinal system in the 20th century. During
this period of stagnation, pharmaceutical
industry based on Ayurveda continued to
exist, but it too declined gradually. It took
about 100-150 years for Indians to learn
and adopt new techniques. During this time,
foreign products poured in. As a result,
indigenous traditional techniques gradually
declined. Modern science appeared in Indian
scene in the later part of the nineteenth
century. By the mid-nineteenth century,
European scientists started coming to India
and modern chemistry started growing.
From the above discussion, you have learnt
that chemistry deals with the composition,
structure, properties and interection of matter
and is of much use to human beings in daily
life. These aspects can be best described and
understood in terms of basic constituents of
matter that are atoms and molecules. That
is why, chemistry is also called the science of
atoms and molecules. Can we see, weigh and
perceive these entities (atoms and molecules)?
Is it possible to count the number of atoms
and molecules in a given mass of matter and
have a quantitative relationship between the
mass and the number of these particles?
We will get the answer of some of these
questions in this Unit. We will further describe
how physical properties of matter can be
quantitatively described using numerical
values with suitable units.

chemistry

1.1	IMPORTANCE OF CHEMISTRY
Chemistry plays a central role in science and
is often intertwined with other branches of
science.
Principles of chemistry are applicable
in diverse areas, such as weather patterns,
functioning of brain and operation of a
computer, production in chemical industries,
manufacturing fertilisers, alkalis, acids, salts,
dyes, polymers, drugs, soaps, detergents,
metals, alloys, etc., including new material.
Chemistry contributes in a big way to the
national economy. It also plays an important
role in meeting human needs for food,
healthcare products and other material
aimed at improving the quality of life. This
is exemplified by the large-scale production
of a variety of fertilisers, improved variety
of pesticides and insecticides. Chemistry
provides methods for the isolation of lifesaving drugs from natural sources and
makes possible synthesis of such drugs.
Some of these drugs are cisplatin and
taxol, which are effective in cancer therapy.
The drug AZT (Azidothymidine) is used for
helping AIDS patients.
Chemistry contributes to a large extent in
the development and growth of a nation. With
a better understanding of chemical principles
it has now become possible to design and
synthesise new material having specific
magnetic, electric and optical properties. This
has lead to the production of superconducting
ceramics, conducting polymers, optical fibres,
etc. Chemistry has helped in establishing
industries which manufacture utility goods,
like acids, alkalies, dyes, polymesr metals,
etc. These industries contribute in a big way
to the economy of a nation and generate
employment.
In recent years, chemistry has helped in
dealing with some of the pressing aspects
of environmental degradation with a fair
degree of success. Safer alternatives to
environmentally hazardous refrigerants,
like CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), responsible
for ozone depletion in the stratosphere, have
been successfully synthesised. However,

many big environmental problems continue to
be matters of grave concern to the chemists.
One such problem is the management of the
Green House gases, like methane, carbon
dioxide, etc. Understanding of biochemical
processes, use of enzymes for large-scale
production of chemicals and synthesis of new
exotic material are some of the intellectual
challenges for the future generation of
chemists. A developing country, like India,
needs talented and creative chemists for
accepting such challenges. To be a good
chemist and to accept such challanges, one
needs to understand the basic concepts of
chemistry, which begin with the concept of
matter. Let us start with the nature of matter.
1.2	Nature of Matter
You are already familiar with the term matter
from your earlier classes. Anything which has
mass and occupies space is called matter.
Everything around us, for example, book, pen,
pencil, water, air, all living beings, etc., are
composed of matter. You know that they have
mass and they occupy space. Let us recall the
characteristics of the states of matter, which
you learnt in your previous classes.
1.2.1 States of Matter
You are aware that matter can exist in three
physical states viz. solid, liquid and gas.
The constituent particles of matter in these
three states can be represented as shown in
Fig. 1.1.
Particles are held very close to each other
in solids in an orderly fashion and there is not
much freedom of movement. In liquids, the
particles are close to each other but they can
move around. However, in gases, the particles
are far apart as compared to those present in
solid or liquid states and their movement is
easy and fast. Because of such arrangement
of particles, different states of matter exhibit
the following characteristics:
(i)
Solids have definite volume and definite
shape.
(ii) Liquids have definite volume but do
not have definite shape. They take the
shape of the container in which they are
placed.

Arrangement of particles in solid, liquid
and gaseous state

Gases have neither definite volume nor
definite shape. They completely occupy
the space in the container in which they
are placed.

These three states of matter are
interconvertible by changing the conditions
of temperature and pressure.
Solid

Gas

On heating, a solid usually changes to
a liquid, and the liquid on further heating
changes to gas (or vapour). In the reverse
process, a gas on cooling liquifies to the liquid
and the liquid on further cooling freezes to
the solid.
1.2.2. Classification of Matter
In Class IX (Chapter 2), you have learnt that
at the macroscopic or bulk level, matter can
be classified as mixture or pure substance.
These can be further sub-divided as shown
in Fig. 1.2.
When all constituent particles of a
substance are same in chemical nature, it
is said to be a pure substance. A mixture
contains many types of particles.
A mixture contains particles of two or
more pure substances which may be present
in it in any ratio. Hence, their composition is
variable. Pure substances forming mixture
are called its components. Many of the
substances present around you are mixtures.
For example, sugar solution in water, air,
tea, etc., are all mixtures. A mixture may
be homogeneous or heterogeneous. In a
homogeneous mixture, the components

Fig. 1.2

Classification of matter

completely mix with each other. This means
particles of components of the mixture are
uniformly distributed throughout the bulk of
the mixture and its composition is uniform
throughout. Sugar solution and air are the
examples of homogeneous mixtures. In
contrast to this, in a heterogeneous mixture,
the composition is not uniform throughout
and sometimes different components are
visible. For example, mixtures of salt and
sugar, grains and pulses along with some
dirt (often stone pieces), are heterogeneous
mixtures. You can think of many more
examples of mixtures which you come across
in the daily life. It is worthwhile to mention
here that the components of a mixture can
be separated by using physical methods,
such as simple hand-picking, filtration,
crystallisation, distillation, etc.
Pure substances have characteristics
different from mixtures. Constituent particles
of pure substances have fixed composition.
Copper, silver, gold, water and glucose are
some examples of pure substances. Glucose
contains carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in
a fixed ratio and its particles are of same
composition. Hence, like all other pure
substances, glucose has a fixed composition.
Also, its constituents—carbon, hydrogen
and oxygen—cannot be separated by simple
physical methods.
Pure substances can further be classified
into elements and compounds. Particles
of an element consist of only one type of
atoms. These particles may exist as atoms or
molecules. You may be familiar with atoms



Unit 1.indd 5

9/9/2022 4:27:30 PM

6

chemistry

and molecules from the previous classes;
however, you will be studying about them
in detail in Unit 2. Sodium, copper, silver,
hydrogen, oxygen, etc., are some examples
of elements. Their all atoms are of one type.
However, the atoms of different elements
are different in nature. Some elements,
such as sodium or copper, contain atoms
as their constituent particles, whereas, in
some others, the constituent particles are
molecules which are formed by two or more
atoms. For example, hydrogen, nitrogen and
oxygen gases consist of molecules, in which
two atoms combine to give their respective
molecules. This is illustrated in Fig. 1.3.

Water molecule
(H2O)
Fig. 1.4

Carbon dioxide
molecule (CO2)

A depiction of molecules of water and
carbon dioxide

elements are present in a compound in a fixed
and definite ratio and this ratio is characteristic
of a particular compound. Also, the properties
of a compound are different from those of its
constituent elements. For example, hydrogen
and oxygen are gases, whereas, the compound
formed by their combination i.e., water is a
liquid. It is interesting to note that hydrogen
burns with a pop sound and oxygen is a
supporter of combustion, but water is used
as a fire extinguisher.
1.3	Properties of Matter and
their Measurement
1.3.1 Physical and chemical properties

Fig. 1.3

A representation of atoms and molecules

When two or more atoms of different
elements combine together in a definite ratio,
the molecule of a compound is obtained.
Moreover, the constituents of a compound
cannot be separated into simpler substances
by physical methods. They can be separated
by chemical methods. Examples of some
compounds are water, ammonia, carbon
dioxide, sugar, etc. The molecules of water
and carbon dioxide are represented in Fig. 1.4.
Note that a water molecule comprises
two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
Similarly, a molecule of carbon dioxide
contains two oxygen atoms combined with
one carbon atom. Thus, the atoms of different

Every substance has unique or characteristic
properties. These properties can be classified
into two categories — physical properties,
such as colour, odour, melting point, boiling
point, density, etc., and chemical properties,
like composition, combustibility, ractivity with
acids and bases, etc.
Physical properties can be measured
or observed without changing the identity
or the composition of the substance. The
measurement or observation of chemical
properties requires a chemical change to
occur. Measurement of physical properties
does not require occurance of a chemical
change. The examples of chemical properties
are characteristic reactions of different
substances; these include acidity or basicity,
combustibility, etc. Chemists describe,
interpret and predict the behaviour of
substances on the basis of knowledge of their
physical and chemical properties, which are
determined by careful measurement and
experimentation. In the following section, we



Unit 1.indd 6

will learn about the measurement of physical
properties.
1.3.2 Measurement of physical properties
Quantitative measurement of properties is
reaquired for scientific investigation. Many
properties of matter, such as length, area,
volume, etc., are quantitative in nature. Any
quantitative observation or measurement is
represented by a number followed by units
in which it is measured. For example, length
of a room can be represented as 6 m; here,
6 is the number and m denotes metre, the
unit in which the length is measured.
Earlier, two different systems of
measurement, i.e., the English System
and the Metric System were being used
in different parts of the world. The metric
system, which originated in France in late
eighteenth century, was more convenient as
it was based on the decimal system. Late,
need of a common standard system was felt
by the scientific community. Such a system
was established in 1960 and is discussed in
detail below.

Maintaining the National
Standards of Measurement
The system of units, including unit
definitions, keeps on changing with time.
Whenever the accuracy of measurement of a
particular unit was enhanced substantially
by adopting new principles, member nations
of metre treaty (signed in 1875), agreed
to change the formal definition of that
unit. Each modern industrialised country,
including India, has a National Metrology
Institute (NMI), which maintains standards of
measurements. This responsibility has been
given to the National Physical Laboratory
(NPL), New Delhi. This laboratory establishes
experiments to realise the base units and
derived units of measurement and maintains
National Standards of Measurement. These
standards are periodically inter-compared
with standards maintained at other National
Metrology Institutes in the world, as well
as those, established at the International
Bureau of Standards in Paris.

1.3.3	The International System of Units (SI)

governmental treaty organisation created by a
diplomatic treaty known as Metre Convention,
which was signed in Paris in 1875.

The International System of Units (in
French Le Systeme International d’Unités
— abbreviated as SI) was established by
the 11th General Conference on Weights and
Measures (CGPM from Conference Generale
des Poids et Measures). The CGPM is an inter-

The SI system has seven base units
and they are listed in Table 1.1. These units
pertain to the seven fundamental scientific
quantities. The other physical quantities,
such as speed, volume, density, etc., can be
derived from these quantities.

The definitions of the SI base units are
given in Table 1.2.
The SI system allows the use of prefixes to
indicate the multiples or submultiples of a unit.

These prefixes are listed in Table 1.3.
Let us now quickly go through some of

Analytical balance

SI system, volume has units of m3. But again,
in chemistry laboratories, smaller volumes
are used. Hence, volume is often denoted in
cm3 or dm3 units.

1.3.4 Mass and Weight
Mass of a substance is the amount of matter
present in it, while weight is the force
exerted by gravity on an object. The mass of
a substance is constant, whereas, its weight
may vary from one place to another due to
change in gravity. You should be careful in
using these terms.

A common unit, litre (L) which is not an
SI unit, is used for measurement of volume
of liquids.
1 L = 1000 mL, 1000 cm3 = 1 dm3
Fig. 1.6 helps to visualise these relations.

The mass of a substance can be determined
accurately in the laboratory by using an
analytical balance (Fig. 1.5).
The SI unit of mass as given in Table 1.1 is
kilogram. However, its fraction named as gram
(1 kg = 1000 g), is used in laboratories due
to the smaller amounts of chemicals used in
chemical reactions.
1.3.5 Volume
Volume is the amont of space occupied by a
substance. It has the units of (length)3. So in

chemistry

In the laboratory, the volume of liquids
or solutions can be measured by graduated
cylinder, burette, pipette, etc. A volumetric
flask is used to prepare a known volume of a
solution. These measuring devices are shown
in Fig. 1.7.

fahrenheit) and K (kelvin). Here, K is the
SI unit. The thermometers based on these
scales are shown in Fig. 1.8. Generally,
the thermometer with celsius scale are
calibrated from 0° to 100°, where these two
temperatures are the freezing point and
the boiling point of water, respectively. The
fahrenheit scale is represented between 32°
to 212°.
The temperatures on two scales are
related to each other by the following
relationship:

The kelvin scale is related to celsius scale
as follows:
K = °C + 273.15
F 

Some volume measuring devices

It is interesting to note that temperature
below 0 °C (i.e., negative values) are possible
in Celsius scale but in Kelvin scale, negative
temperature is not possible.

1.3.6 Density
The two properties — mass and volume
discussed above are related as follows:

Mass
Volume
Density of a substance is its amount of mass
per unit volume. So, SI units of density can
be obtained as follows:
Density =

SI unit of density =

kg
or kg m–3
m3
This unit is quite large and a chemist often
expresses density in g cm–3, where mass is
expressed in gram and volume is expressed
in cm3. Density of a substance tells us about
how closely its particles are packed. If density
is more, it means particles are more closely
packed.

1.3.7	Temperature
There are three common scales to measure
temperature — °C (degree celsius), °F (degree

1.4 Uncertainty in Measurement
Many a time in the study of chemistry, one
has to deal with experimental data as well as
theoretical calculations. There are meaningful
ways to handle the numbers conveniently and

Reference Standard
After defining a unit of measurement such as
the kilogram or the metre, scientists agreed
on reference standards that make it possible
to calibrate all measuring devices. For getting
reliable measurements, all devices such as
metre sticks and analytical balances have
been calibrated by their manufacturers
to give correct readings. However, each of
these devices is standardised or calibrated
against some reference. The mass standard
is the kilogram since 1889. It has been
defined as the mass of platinum-iridium
(Pt-Ir) cylinder that is stored in an airtight
jar at International Bureau of Weights
and Measures in Sevres, France. Pt-Ir was
chosen for this standard because it is highly
resistant to chemical attack and its mass
will not change for an extremely long time.
Scientists are in search of a new
standard for mass. This is being attempted
through accurate determination of Avogadro
constant. Work on this new standard focuses
on ways to measure accurately the number
of atoms in a well-defined mass of sample.
One such method, which uses X-rays to
determine the atomic density of a crystal of
ultrapure silicon, has an accuracy of about
1 part in 106 but has not yet been adopted to
serve as a standard. There are other methods
but none of them are presently adequate to
replace the Pt-Ir cylinder. No doubt, changes
are expected within this decade.
The metre was originally defined as the
length between two marks on a Pt-Ir bar
kept at a temperature of 0°C (273.15 K). In
1960 the length of the metre was defined as
1.65076373 × 106 times the wavelength of
light emitted by a krypton laser. Although
this was a cumbersome number, it preserved
the length of the metre at its agreed value.
The metre was redefined in 1983 by CGPM
as the length of path travelled by light in
vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792
458 of a second. Similar to the length and
the mass, there are reference standards for
other physical quantities.

present the data realistically with certainty to
the extent possible. These ideas are discussed
below in detail.
1.4.1 Scientific Notation
As chemistry is the study of atoms and
molecules, which have extremely low masses
and are present in extremely large numbers,
a chemist has to deal with numbers as large
as 602, 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 for the
molecules of 2 g of hydrogen gas or as small as
0.00000000000000000000000166 g mass of
a H atom. Similarly, other constants such as
Planck’s constant, speed of light, charges on
particles, etc., involve numbers of the above
magnitude.
It may look funny for a moment to
write or count numbers involving so many
zeros but it offers a real challenge to do
simple mathematical operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication or division with
such numbers. You can write any two
numbers of the above type and try any one
of the operations you like to accept as a
challenge, and then, you will really appreciate
the difficulty in handling such numbers.
This problem is solved by using scientific
notation for such numbers, i.e., exponential
notation in which any number can be
represented in the form N × 10n, where n is an
exponent having positive or negative values
and N is a number (called digit term) which
varies between 1.000... and 9.999....
Thus, we can write 232.508 as
2.32508 × 102 in scientific notation. Note that
while writing it, the decimal had to be moved
to the left by two places and same is the
exponent (2) of 10 in the scientific notation.
Similarly, 0.00016 can be written as
1.6 × 10 –4 . Here, the decimal has to be
moved four places to the right and (–4) is the
exponent in the scientific notation.
While performing mathematical operations
on numbers expressed in scientific notations,
the following points are to be kept in mind.

Multiplication and Division
These two operations follow the same rules
which are there for exponential numbers, i.e.

Addition and Subtraction
For these two operations, first the numbers are
written in such a way that they have the same
exponent. After that, the coefficients (digit
terms) are added or subtracted as the case
may be.
Thus, for adding 6.65×104 and 8.95×103,
exponent is made same for both the numbers.
Thus, we get (6.65×104) + (0.895×104)
Then, these numbers can be added as follows
(6.65 + 0.895)×104 = 7.545×104
Similarly, the subtraction of two numbers can
be done as shown below:
(2.5 × 10–2) – (4.8 ×10–3)
= (2.5 × 10–2) – (0.48 × 10–2)
= (2.5 – 0.48)×10–2 = 2.02 × 10–2
1.4.2 Significant Figures
Every experimental measurement has
some amount of uncertainty associated
with it because of limitation of measuring
instrument and the skill of the person making
the measurement. For example, mass of an
object is obtained using a platform balance
and it comes out to be 9.4g. On measuring
the mass of this object on an analytical
balance, the mass obtained is 9.4213g. The

mass obtained by an analytical balance is
slightly higher than the mass obtained by
using a platform balance. Therefore, digit 4
placed after decimal in the measurement by
platform balance is uncertain.
The uncertainty in the experimental
or the calculated values is indicated by
mentioning the number of significant
figures. Significant figures are meaningful
digits which are known with certainty plus
one which is estimated or uncertain. The
uncertainty is indicated by writing the certain
digits and the last uncertain digit. Thus, if we
write a result as 11.2 mL, we say the 11 is
certain and 2 is uncertain and the uncertainty
would be +1 in the last digit. Unless otherwise
stated, an uncertainty of +1 in the last digit
is always understood.
There are certain rules for determining
the number of significant figures. These are
stated below:
(1) All non-zero digits are significant. For
example in 285 cm, there are three
significant figures and in 0.25 mL, there
are two significant figures.
(2) Zeros preceding to first non-zero digit
are not significant. Such zero indicates
the position of decimal point. Thus,
0.03 has one significant figure and
0.0052 has two significant figures.
(3) Zeros between two non-zero digits
are significant. Thus, 2.005 has four
significant figures.
(4) Zeros at the end or right of a number
are significant, provided they are on
the right side of the decimal point. For
example, 0.200 g has three significant
figures. But, if otherwise, the terminal
zeros are not significant if there is no
decimal point. For example, 100 has
only one significant figure, but 100 has
three significant figures and 100.0 has
four significant figures. Such numbers
are better represented in scientific
notation. We can express the number
100 as 1×102 for one significant figure,
1.0×102 for two significant figures and
1.00×102 for three significant figures.

(5)

Counting the numbers of object, for
example, 2 balls or 20 eggs, have infinite
significant figures as these are exact
numbers and can be represented by
writing infinite number of zeros after
placing a decimal i.e., 2 = 2.000000 or
20 = 20.000000.
In numbers written in scientific notation,
all digits are significant e.g., 4.01×102 has
three significant figures, and 8.256×10–3 has
four significant figures.
However, one would always like the results
to be precise and accurate. Precision and
accuracy are often referred to while we talk
about the measurement.
Precision refers to the closeness of
various measurements for the same quantity.
However, accuracy is the agreement of a
particular value to the true value of the
result. For example, if the true value for a
result is 2.00 g and student ‘A’ takes two
measurements and reports the results as 1.95
g and 1.93 g. These values are precise as they
are close to each other but are not accurate.
Another student ‘B’ repeats the experiment
and obtains 1.94 g and 2.05 g as the results
for two measurements. These observations
are neither precise nor accurate. When the
third student ‘C’ repeats these measurements
and reports 2.01 g and 1.99 g as the result,
these values are both precise and accurate.
This can be more clearly understood from the
data given in Table 1.4.

and Accuracy

The result cannot have more digits to the right

numbers.

31.122

Here, 18.0 has only one digit after the decimal
point and the result should be reported only
up to one digit after the decimal point, which
is 31.1.

Multiplication and Division of
Significant Figures
In these operations, the result must be
reported with no more significant figures as
in the measurement with the few significant
figures.
2.5×1.25 = 3.125
Since 2.5 has two significant figures,
the result should not have more than two
significant figures, thus, it is 3.1.
While limiting the result to the required
number of significant figures as done in the
above mathematical operation, one has to
keep in mind the following points for rounding
off the numbers
1.
If the rightmost digit to be removed is
more than 5, the preceding number is
increased by one. For example, 1.386. If
we have to remove 6, we have to round
it to 1.39.
2.
If the rightmost digit to be removed is
less than 5, the preceding number is not
changed. For example, 4.334 if 4 is to
be removed, then the result is rounded
upto 4.33.
If the rightmost digit to be removed is 5,
3.
then the preceding number is not changed
if it is an even number but it is increased
by one if it is an odd number. For example,
if 6.35 is to be rounded by removing 5, we
have to increase 3 to 4 giving 6.4 as the
result. However, if 6.25 is to be rounded
off it is rounded off to 6.2.
1.4.3 Dimensional Analysis
Often while calculating, there is a need to
convert units from one system to the other.
The method used to accomplish this is called
factor label method or unit factor method
or dimensional analysis. This is illustrated
below.
Example
A piece of metal is 3 inch (represented by in)
long. What is its length in cm?

How many seconds are there in 2 days?

Solution
Thus,

2.54 cm

1 in
2.54 cm

also equals 1. Both of these are called unit
factors. If some number is multiplied by these
unit factors (i.e., 1), it will not be affected
otherwise.
Say, the 3 in given above is multiplied by
the unit factor. So,
2.54 cm
3 in = 3 in ×
= 3 × 2.54 cm = 7.62 cm
1 in
Now, the unit factor by which multiplication
2.54 cm
is to be done is that unit factor (
in
1 in
the above case) which gives the desired units
i.e., the numerator should have that part
which is required in the desired result.
It should also be noted in the above
example that units can be handled just like
other numerical part. It can be cancelled,
divided, multiplied, squared, etc. Let us study
one more example.

Example
A jug contains 2 L of milk. Calculate the
volume of the milk in m3.

Solution
Since 1 L = 1000 cm3
and 1m = 100 cm, which gives

100 cm
1m
= 1=
1m
100 cm
To get m3 from the above unit factors, the
first unit factor is taken and it is cubed.

1.5	Laws of Chemical
Combinations
The combination of elements
to form compounds is
governed by the following five
basic laws.

Antoine Lavoisier
(1743–1794)

1.5.1	Law of Conservation
of Mass
This law was put forth by Antoine Lavoisier
in 1789. He performed careful experimental
studies for combustion reactions and reached
to the conclusion that in all physical and
chemical changes, there is no net change in
mass duting the process. Hence, he reached
to the conclusion that matter can neither be
created nor destroyed. This is called ‘Law
of Conservation of Mass’. This law formed
the basis for several later developments in
chemistry. Infact, this was the result of exact
measurement of masses of reactants and
products, and carefully planned experiments
performed by Lavoisier.



Unit 1.indd 14

Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry

15

1.5.2 Law of Definite Proportions
This law was given by, a
French chemist, Joseph
Proust. He stated that a given
compound always contains
exactly the same proportion of
elements by weight.
Proust worked with two Joseph Proust
samples of cupric carbonate
(1754–1826)
— one of which was of natural
origin and the other was synthetic. He found
that the composition of elements present in it
was same for both the samples as shown below:
% of
copper

% of
carbon

% of
oxygen

Natural Sample

51.35

9.74

38.91

Synthetic Sample

51.35

9.74

38.91

Thus, he concluded that irrespective of the
source, a given compound always contains
same elements combined together in the same
proportion by mass. The validity of this law
has been confirmed by various experiments.
It is sometimes also referred to as Law of
Definite Composition.
1.5.3	Law of Multiple Proportions
This law was proposed by Dalton in 1803.
According to this law, if two elements can
combine to form more than one compound,
the masses of one element that combine with
a fixed mass of the other element, are in the
ratio of small whole numbers.
For example, hydrogen combines with
oxygen to form two compounds, namely, water
and hydrogen peroxide.
Hydrogen + Oxygen → Water
2g

16g

18g

Hydrogen + Oxygen → Hydrogen Peroxide
2g
32g
34g
Here, the masses of oxygen (i.e., 16 g and 32 g),
which combine with a fixed mass of hydrogen
(2g) bear a simple ratio, i.e., 16:32 or 1: 2.
1.5.4 Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous
	Volumes
This law was given by Gay Lussac in 1808.
He observed that when gases combine or

are produced in a chemical
reaction they do so in a
simple ratio by volume,
provided all gases are at
the same temperature and
pressure.
Thus, 100 mL of hydrogen
Joseph Louis
Gay Lussac
combine with 50 mL of
oxygen to give 100 mL of
water vapour.
Hydrogen + Oxygen → Water
100 mL
50 mL
100 mL
Thus, the volumes of hydrogen and
oxygen which combine (i.e., 100 mL and
50 mL) bear a simple ratio of 2:1.
Gay Lussac’s discovery of integer ratio
in volume relationship is actually the law of
definite proportions by volume. The law of
definite proportions, stated earlier, was with
respect to mass. The Gay Lussac’s law was
explained properly by the work of Avogadro
in 1811.
1.5.5	Avogadro’s Law
In 1811, Avogadro proposed that equal
volumes of all gases at the same temperature
and pressure should contain equal number
of molecules. Avogadro made a distinction
between atoms and molecules which is
quite understandable in present times. If
we consider again the reaction of hydrogen
and oxygen to produce water, we see that
two volumes of hydrogen combine with one
volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water
without leaving any unreacted oxygen.
Note that in the Fig. 1.9 (Page 16) each
box contains equal number of
molecules. In fact, Avogadro
could explain the above result
by considering the molecules
to be polyatomic. If hydrogen
and oxygen were considered
as diatomic as recognised
now, then the above results Lorenzo Romano
Amedeo Carlo
are easily understandable.
Avogadro di
However, Dalton and others
Quareqa edi
believed at that time that

chemistry

Fig. 1.9 Two volumes of hydrogen react with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of water vapour

cannot combine and molecules of oxygen or
hydrogen containing two atoms did not exist.
Avogadro’s proposal was published in the
French Journal de Physique. In spite of being
correct, it did not gain much support.
After about 50 years, in 1860, the first
international conference on chemistry was
held in Karlsruhe, Germany, to resolve
various ideas. At the meeting, Stanislao
Cannizaro presented a sketch of a course of
chemical philosophy, which emphasised on
the importance of Avogadro’s work.

1.7	Atomic and Molecular Masses
After having some idea about the terms
atoms and molecules, it is appropriate here
to understand what do we mean by atomic
and molecular masses.

1.6 Dalton’s Atomic Theory
Although the origin of the idea that matter is
composed of small indivisible particles called
‘a-tomio’ (meaning, indivisible), dates back
to the time of Democritus,
a Greek Philosopher (460–
370 BC), it again started
emerging as a result of several
experimental studies which
led to the laws mentioned
above.
In 1808, Dalton published
John Dalton
(1776–1884)
‘A New System of Chemical
Philosophy’, in which he
proposed the following :
1. Matter consists of indivisible atoms.
2. All atoms of a given element have identical
properties, including identical mass. Atoms
of different elements differ in mass.
3. Compounds are formed when atoms of
different elements combine in a fixed ratio.
4. Chemical reactions involve reorganisation
of atoms. These are neither created nor
destroyed in a chemical reaction.

1.7.1	Atomic Mass
The atomic mass or the mass of an atom is
actually very-very small because atoms are
extremely small. Today, we have sophisticated
techniques e.g., mass spectrometry for
determining the atomic masses fairly
accurately. But in the nineteenth century,
scientists could determine the mass of one
atom relative to another by experimental
means, as has been mentioned earlier.
Hydrogen, being the lightest atom was
arbitrarily assigned a mass of 1 (without
any units) and other elements were assigned
masses relative to it. However, the present
system of atomic masses is based on
carbon-12 as the standard and has been
agreed upon in 1961. Here, Carbon-12 is
one of the isotopes of carbon and can be
represented as 12C. In this system, 12C is
assigned a mass of exactly 12 atomic mass
unit (amu) and masses of all other atoms are
given relative to this standard. One atomic
mass unit is defined as a mass exactly equal
to one-twelfth of the mass of one carbon – 12
atom.

Dalton’s theory could explain the laws
of chemical combination. However, it could
not explain the laws of gaseous volumes. It
could not provide the reason for combining
of atoms, which was answered later by other
scientists.

And 1 amu = 1.66056×10–24 g
Mass of an atom of hydrogen
= 1.6736×10–24 g
Thus, in terms of amu, the mass
of hydrogen atom

=
= 1.0078 amu
= 1.0080 amu

Similarly, the mass of oxygen - 16 (16O)
atom would be 15.995 amu.
At present, ‘amu’ has been replaced by
‘u’, which is known as unified mass.
When we use atomic masses of elements
in calculations, we actually use average
atomic masses of elements, which are
explained below.
1.7.2	Average Atomic Mass
Many naturally occurring elements exist
as more than one isotope. When we take
into account the existence of these isotopes
and their relative abundance (per cent
occurrence), the average atomic mass of
that element can be computed. For example,
carbon has the following three isotopes with
relative abundances and masses as shown
against each of them.

From the above data, the average atomic
mass of carbon will come out to be:
(0.98892) (12 u) + (0.01108) (13.00335 u) +
(2 × 10–12) (14.00317 u) = 12.011 u
Similarly, average atomic masses for
other elements can be calculated. In the
periodic table of elements, the atomic masses
mentioned for different elements actually
represent their average atomic masses.

1.7.3	Molecular Mass
Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses
of the elements present in a molecule. It is
obtained by multiplying the atomic mass
of each element by the number of its atoms
and adding them together. For example,
molecular mass of methane, which contains
one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms,
can be obtained as follows:
Molecular mass of methane,
(CH4) = (12.011 u) + 4 (1.008 u)
= 16.043 u
Similarly, molecular mass of water (H2O)
= 2 × atomic mass of hydrogen + 1× atomic
mass of oxygen
= 2 (1.008 u) + 16.00 u
= 18.02 u
1.7.4	Formula Mass
Some substances, such as sodium chloride,
do not contain discrete molecules as their
constituent units. In such compounds,
positive (sodium ion) and negative (chloride ion)
entities are arranged in a three-dimensional
structure, as shown in Fig. 1.10.

Fig. 1.10

Packing of Na+ and Cl– ions
in sodium chloride

It may be noted that in sodium chloride,
one Na+ ion is surrounded by six Cl– ion and
vice-versa.
The formula, such as NaCl, is used to
calculate the formula mass instead of
molecular mass as in the solid state sodium
chloride does not exist as a single entity.

chemistry

Thus, the formula mass of sodium chloride is
atomic mass of sodium + atomic mass of chlorine
= 23.0 u + 35.5 u = 58.5 u
Problem 1.1
Calculate the molecular mass of glucose
(C6H12O6) molecule.
Solution
Molecular mass of glucose (C6H12O6)
= 6 (12.011 u) + 12 (1.008 u) +
6 (16.00 u)
= (72.066 u) + (12.096 u) +
(96.00 u)
= 180.162 u
1.8	Mole concept and Molar Masses
Atoms and molecules are extremely small
in size and their numbers in even a small
amount of any substance is really very large.
To handle such large numbers, a unit of
convenient magnitude is required.
Just as we denote one dozen for 12 items,
score for 20 items, gross for 144 items, we
use the idea of mole to count entities at the
microscopic level (i.e., atoms, molecules,
particles, electrons, ions, etc).
In SI system, mole (symbol, mol) was
introduced as seventh base quantity for the
amount of a substance.
The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of
amount of substance. One mole contains
exactly 6.02214076 × 1023 elementary entities.
This number is the fixed numerical value of
the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed
in the unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro
number. The amount of substance, symbol
n, of a system is a measure of the number of
specified elementary entities. An elementary
entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion,
an electron, any other particle or specified
group of particles. It may be emphasised that
the mole of a substance always contains the
same number of entities, no matter what the
substance may be. In order to determine this
number precisely, the mass of a carbon–12
atom was determined by a mass spectrometer
and found to be equal to 1.992648 × 10–23 g.
Knowing that one mole of carbon weighs 12 g,
the number of atoms in it is equal to:
12 g / mol 12C
1.992648  10 23 g /12 C atom
 6.0221367  1023 atoms/mol

This number of entities in 1 mol is so
important that it is given a separate name and
symbol. It is known as ‘Avogadro constant’,
or Avogadro number denoted by NA in honour
of Amedeo Avogadro. To appreciate the
largeness of this number, let us write it with
all zeroes without using any powers of ten.
602213670000000000000000
Hence, so many entities (atoms, molecules or
any other particle) constitute one mole of a
particular substance.
We can, therefore, say that 1 mol of hydrogen
atoms = 6.022 × 1023 atoms
1 mol of water molecules = 6.022 × 1023 water
molecules
1 mol of sodium chloride = 6.022 ×1023 formula
units of sodium chloride
Having defined the mole, it is easier to
know the mass of one mole of a substance
or the constituent entities. The mass of one
mole of a substance in grams is called its
molar mass. The molar mass in grams is
numerically equal to atomic/molecular/
formula mass in u.
Molar mass of water = 18.02 g mol–1
Molar mass of sodium chloride = 58.5 g mol–1
1.9	Percentage Composition
So far, we were dealing with the number of
entities present in a given sample. But many
a time, information regarding the percentage
of a particular element present in a compound
is required. Suppose, an unknown or new
compound is given to you, the first question

One mole of various substances

you would ask is: what is its formula or what
are its constituents and in what ratio are they
present in the given compound? For known
compounds also, such information provides a
check whether the given sample contains the
same percentage of elements as present in a
pure sample. In other words, one can check
the purity of a given sample by analysing this
data.
Let us understand it by taking the example
of water (H2O). Since water contains hydrogen
and oxygen, the percentage composition of
both these elements can be calculated as
follows:
Mass % of an element =
mass of that element in the compound × 100
molar mass of the compound

If the mass per cent of various elements
present in a compound is known, its empirical
formula can be determined. Molecular formula
can further be obtained if the molar mass is
known. The following example illustrates
this sequence.

Problem 1.2
A compound contains 4.07% hydrogen,
24.27% carbon and 71.65% chlorine.
Its molar mass is 98.96 g. What are its
empirical and molecular formulas?

Molar mass of water = 18.02 g
Mass % of hydrogen =

Mass % of oxygen

1.9.1	Empirical Formula for Molecular
	Formula
An empirical formula represents the simplest
whole number ratio of various atoms present
in a compound, whereas, the molecular
formula shows the exact number of different
types of atoms present in a molecule of a
compound.

16.00

Solution
Step 1. Conversion of mass per cent
to grams

Let us take one more example. What is the
percentage of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
in ethanol?
Molecular formula of ethanol is: C2H5OH
Molar mass of ethanol is:
(2×12.01 + 6×1.008 + 16.00) g = 46.068 g
Mass per cent of carbon 		
24.02 g
=
× 100 = 52.14%
46.068 g
Mass per cent of hydrogen		
6.048 g
× 100 = 13.13%
=
46.068 g
Mass per cent of oxygen		
16.00 g
× 100 = 34.73%
=
46.068 g
After understanding the calculation of
per cent of mass, let us now see what
information can be obtained from the
per cent composition data.

Since we are having mass per cent, it is
convenient to use 100 g of the compound
as the starting material. Thus, in the
100 g sample of the above compound,
4.07g hydrogen, 24.27g carbon and
71.65g chlorine are present.
Step 2. Convert into number moles of
each element
Divide the masses obtained above by
respective atomic masses of various
elements. This gives the number of
moles of constituent elements in the
compound
Moles of hydrogen =
Moles of carbon =

4.07 g
= 4.04

Moles of chlorine =

= 2.021

chemistry

Step 3. Divide each of the mole values
obtained above by the smallest number
amongst them
Since 2.021 is smallest value, division
by it gives a ratio of 2:1:1 for H:C:Cl.
In case the ratios are not whole numbers,
then they may be converted into whole
number by multiplying by the suitable
coefficient.
Step 4. Write down the empirical
formula by mentioning the numbers
after writing the symbols of respective
elements
CH2Cl is, thus, the empirical formula
of the above compound.
Step 5. Writing molecular formula
(a) Determine empirical formula mass by
adding the atomic masses of various
atoms present in the empirical formula.
For CH2Cl, empirical formula mass is
12.01 + (2 ×1.008) + 35.453
= 49.48 g
(b) Divide Molar mass by empirical
formula mass

= 2 = (n)
(c) Multiply empirical formula by n
obtained above to get the molecular
formula
Empirical formula = CH2Cl, n = 2. Hence
molecular formula is C2H4Cl2.
1.10 Stoichiometry and		
Stoichiometric Calculations
The word ‘stoichiometry’ is derived from
two Greek words — stoicheion (meaning,
element) and metron (meaning, measure).
Stoichiometry, thus, deals with the calculation
of masses (sometimes volumes also) of the
reactants and the products involved in a
chemical reaction. Before understanding how
to calculate the amounts of reactants required
or the products produced in a chemical
reaction, let us study what information
is available from the balanced chemical

equation of a given reaction. Let us consider
the combustion of methane. A balanced
equation for this reaction is as given below:
CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2 H2O (g)
Here, methane and dioxygen are called
reactants and carbon dioxide and water are
called products. Note that all the reactants
and the products are gases in the above
reaction and this has been indicated by
letter (g) in the brackets next to its formula.
Similarly, in case of solids and liquids, (s) and
(l) are written respectively.
The coefficients 2 for O 2 and H2O are
called stoichiometric coefficients. Similarly
the coefficient for CH4 and CO2 is one in each
case. They represent the number of molecules
(and moles as well) taking part in the reaction
or formed in the reaction.
Thus, according to the above chemical
reaction,
• One mole of CH4(g) reacts with two moles
of O2(g) to give one mole of CO2(g) and
two moles of H2O(g)

•

One molecule of CH 4 (g) reacts with
2 molecules of O2(g) to give one molecule
of CO2(g) and 2 molecules of H2O(g)

•

22.7 L of CH4(g) reacts with 45.4 L of O2
(g) to give 22.7 L of CO2 (g) and 45.4 L of
H2O(g)

•

16 g of CH4 (g) reacts with 2×32 g of O2
(g) to give 44 g of CO2 (g) and 2×18 g of
H2O (g).
From these relationships, the given data can
be interconverted as follows:
mass

1.10.1	Limiting Reagent

Many a time, reactions are carried out with
the amounts of reactants that are different
than the amounts as required by a balanced
chemical reaction. In such situations, one
reactant is in more amount than the amount
required by balanced chemical reaction. The

important to understand as how the amount
of substance is expressed when it is present in
the solution. The concentration of a solution
or the amount of substance present in its
given volume can be expressed in any of the
following ways.
1. Mass per cent or weight per cent (w/w %)
2. Mole fraction
3. Molarity
4. Molality

A majority of reactions in the laboratories
are carried out in solutions. Therefore, it is

detail.

reactant which is present in the least amount
gets consumed after sometime and after that
further reaction does not take place whatever
be the amount of the other reactant. Hence,
the reactant, which gets consumed first,
limits the amount of product formed and is,
therefore, called the limiting reagent.
In performing stoichiometric calculations,
this aspect is also to be kept in mind.

Balancing a chemical equation
According to the law of conservation of mass, a balanced chemical equation has the same number of
atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. Many chemical equations can be balanced by
trial and error. Let us take the reactions of a few metals and non-metals with oxygen to give oxides
(a) balanced equation
		
4 Fe(s) + 3O2(g) → 2Fe2O3(s)		
(b) balanced equation
		
2 Mg(s) + O2(g) → 2MgO(s)		
(c) unbalanced equation
		
P4(s) + O2 (g) → P4O10(s)		
Equations (a) and (b) are balanced, since there are same number of metal and oxygen atoms on
each side of the equations. However equation (c) is not balanced. In this equation, phosphorus
atoms are balanced but not the oxygen atoms. To balance it, we must place the coefficient 5 on
the left of oxygen on the left side of the equation to balance the oxygen atoms appearing on the
right side of the equation.
balanced equation
		
P4(s) + 5O2(g) → P4O10(s)		
Now, let us take combustion of propane, C3H8. This equation can be balanced in steps.
Step 1 Write down the correct formulas of reactants and products. Here, propane and oxygen are
reactants, and carbon dioxide and water are products.
		
C3H8(g) + O2(g) → CO2 (g) + H2O(l) unbalanced equation
Step 2 Balance the number of C atoms: Since 3 carbon atoms are in the reactant, therefore, three
CO2 molecules are required on the right side.
C3H8 (g) + O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + H2O (l)
Step 3 Balance the number of H atoms: on the left there are 8 hydrogen atoms in the reactants
however, each molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms, so four molecules of water will be
required for eight hydrogen atoms on the right side.
		
C3H8 (g) +O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g)+4H2O (l)
Step 4 Balance the number of O atoms: There are 10 oxygen atoms on the right side (3 × 2 = 6 in
CO2 and 4×1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 CO2
and 4×1= 4 in water). Therefore, five O2 molecules are needed to supply the required 10 oxygen
atoms.
		
C3H8 (g) +5O2 (g) → 3CO2 (g) + 4H2O (l)
Step 5 Verify that the number of atoms of each element is balanced in the final equation. The
equation shows three carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms on each side.
All equations that have correct formulas for all reactants and products can be balanced. Always
remember that subscripts in formulas of reactants and products cannot be changed to balance
an equation.

Solution
A balanced equation for the above

The balanced equation for the

Calculation of moles :

(i) 16 g of CH4 corresponds to one mole.

(ii) From the above equation, 1 mol of

Problem 1.4
How many moles of methane are

Solution
According to the chemical equation,
CH4 (g) + 2O2 (g) → CO2 (g) + 2H2O (g)
44g CO2 (g) is obtained from 16 g CH4 (g).
[∴ 1 mol CO2(g) is obtained from 1 mol
of CH4(g)]

But we have only 4.96×10 3 mol H 2.
Hence, dihydrogen is the limiting
reagent in this case. So, NH3(g) would
be formed only from that amount of
available dihydrogen i.e., 4.96 × 103 mol

22 g CO2 (g).

3. Molarity

It is the most widely used unit and is denoted
by M. It is defined as the number of moles of
the solute in 1 litre of the solution. Thus,

= 56.1×103 g NH3
= 56.1 kg NH3

No. of moles of solute
Volume of solution in litres
Suppose, we have 1 M solution of a
substance, say NaOH, and we want to prepare
a 0.2 M solution from it.
1 M NaOH means 1 mol of NaOH present
in 1 litre of the solution. For 0.2 M solution,
we require 0.2 moles of NaOH dissolved in
1 litre solution.
Hence, for making 0.2M solution from 1M
solution, we have to take that volume of 1M
NaOH solution, which contains 0.2 mol of NaOH
and dilute the solution with water to 1 litre.
Now, how much volume of concentrated
(1M) NaOH solution be taken, which contains
0.2 moles of NaOH can be calculated as follows:
If 1 mol is present in 1L or 1000 mL
solution
then, 0.2 mol is present in

Molarity (M) =

1. Mass per cent
It is obtained by using the following relation:

Problem 1.6
A solution is prepared by adding 2 g of a
substance A to 18 g of water. Calculate
the mass per cent of the solute.
Solution

1000 mL
× 0.2 mol solution

2. Mole Fraction
It is the ratio of number of moles of a
particular component to the total number
of moles of the solution. If a substance ‘A’
dissolves in substance ‘B’ and their number
of moles are nA and nB, respectively, then the
mole fractions of A and B are given as:

= 200 mL solution
Thus, 200 mL of 1M NaOH are taken and
enough water is added to dilute it to make it 1 litre.
In fact for such calculations, a general
formula, M1×V1 = M2 × V2 where M and V are
molarity and volume, respectively, can be used.
In this case, M1 is equal to 0.2M; V1 = 1000
mL and, M2 = 1.0M; V2 is to be calculated.
Substituting the values in the formula:
0.2 M × 1000 mL = 1.0 M × V2

Note that the number of moles of solute
(NaOH) was 0.2 in 200 mL and it has remained
the same, i.e., 0.2 even after dilution ( in 1000
mL) as we have changed just the amount
of solvent (i.e., water) and have not done
anything with respect to NaOH. But keep in
mind the concentration.

Mass of

(since density = 1.25 g mL–1)
Mass of water in solution = 1250 –75.5
= 1074.5 g
Molality =

Note that molarity of a solution depends
upon temperature because volume of a
solution is temperature dependent.

4. Molality
It is defined as the number of moles of solute
present in 1 kg of solvent. It is denoted by m.
Thus, Molality (m) =

No. of moles of solute
Mass of solvent in kg

Often in a chemistry laboratory, a
solution of a desired concentration is
prepared by diluting a solution of known
higher concentration. The solution of
higher concentration is also known as
stock solution. Note that the molality
of a solution does not change with
temperature since mass remains
unaffected with temperature.

Summary
Chemistry, as we understand it today is not a very old discipline. People in ancient India,
already had the knowledge of many scientific phenomenon much before the advent of
modern science. They applied the knowledge in various walks of life.
The study of chemistry is very important as its domain encompasses every sphere
of life. Chemists study the properties and structure of substances and the changes
undergone by them. All substances contain matter, which can exist in three states –
solid, liquid or gas. The constituent particles are held in different ways in these states
of matter and they exhibit their characteristic properties. Matter can also be classified
into elements, compounds or mixtures. An element contains particles of only one type,
which may be atoms or molecules. The compounds are formed where atoms of two or
more elements combine in a fixed ratio to each other. Mixtures occur widely and many
of the substances present around us are mixtures.
When the properties of a substance are studied, measurement is inherent. The
quantification of properties requires a system of measurement and units in which the
quantities are to be expressed. Many systems of measurement exist, of which the English

and the Metric Systems are widely used. The scientific community, however, has agreed to
have a uniform and common system throughout the world, which is abbreviated as SI units
(International System of Units).
Since measurements involve recording of data, which are always associated with a certain
amount of uncertainty, the proper handling of data obtained by measuring the quantities
is very important. The measurements of quantities in chemistry are spread over a wide
range of 10–31 to 10+23. Hence, a convenient system of expressing the numbers in scientific
notation is used. The uncertainty is taken care of by specifying the number of significant
figures, in which the observations are reported. The dimensional analysis helps to express
the measured quantities in different systems of units. Hence, it is possible to interconvert
the results from one system of units to another.
The combination of different atoms is governed by basic laws of chemical combination
— these being the Law of Conservation of Mass, Law of Definite Proportions, Law of
Multiple Proportions, Gay Lussac’s Law of Gaseous Volumes and Avogadro Law. All
these laws led to the Dalton’s atomic theory, which states that atoms are building blocks
of matter. The atomic mass of an element is expressed relative to 12C isotope of carbon,
which has an exact value of 12u. Usually, the atomic mass used for an element is the
average atomic mass obtained by taking into account the natural abundance of different
isotopes of that element. The molecular mass of a molecule is obtained by taking sum of
the atomic masses of different atoms present in a molecule. The molecular formula can be
calculated by determining the mass per cent of different elements present in a compound
and its molecular mass.
The number of atoms, molecules or any other particles present in a given system are
expressed in the terms of Avogadro constant (6.022 × 1023). This is known as 1 mol of the
respective particles or entities.
Chemical reactions represent the chemical changes undergone by different elements and
compounds. A balanced chemical equation provides a lot of information. The coefficients
indicate the molar ratios and the respective number of particles taking part in a particular
reaction. The quantitative study of the reactants required or the products formed is called
stoichiometry. Using stoichiometric calculations, the amount of one or more reactant(s)
required to produce a particular amount of product can be determined and vice-versa. The
amount of substance present in a given volume of a solution is expressed in number of ways,
e.g., mass per cent, mole fraction, molarity and molality.

The existence of atoms has been proposed since the time
of early Indian and Greek philosophers (400 B.C.) who
were of the view that atoms are the fundamental building
blocks of matter. According to them, the continued
subdivisions of matter would ultimately yield atoms
which would not be further divisible. The word ‘atom’
has been derived from the Greek word ‘a-tomio’ which
means ‘uncut-able’ or ‘non-divisible’. These earlier ideas
were mere speculations and there was no way to test
them experimentally. These ideas remained dormant for
a very long time and were revived again by scientists in
the nineteenth century.
The atomic theory of matter was first proposed
on a firm scientific basis by John Dalton, a British
school teacher in 1808. His theory, called Dalton’s
atomic theory, regarded the atom as the ultimate
particle of matter (Unit 1). Dalton’s atomic theory was
able to explain the law of conservation of mass, law of
constant composition and law of multiple proportion
very successfully. However, it failed to explain the results
of many experiments, for example, it was known that
substances like glass or ebonite when rubbed with silk
or fur get electrically charged.
In this unit we start with the experimental observations
made by scientists towards the end of nineteenth and
beginning of twentieth century. These established that
atoms are made of sub-atomic particles, i.e., electrons,
protons and neutrons — a concept very different from
that of Dalton.

Discovery of Sub-atomic
Particles

An insight into the structure of atom was
obtained from the experiments on electrical
discharge through gases. Before we discuss
these results we need to keep in mind a
basic rule regarding the behaviour of charged
particles : “Like charges repel each other and
unlike charges attract each other”.

Fig. 2.1(a) A cathode ray discharge tube

2.1.1 Discovery of Electron
In 1830, Michael Faraday showed that if
electricity is passed through a solution of an
electrolyte, chemical reactions occurred at the
electrodes, which resulted in the liberation
and deposition of matter at the electrodes.
He formulated certain laws which you will
study in Class XII. These results suggested
the particulate nature of electricity.
In mid 1850s many scientists mainly
Faraday began to study electrical discharge
in partially evacuated tubes, known as
cathode ray discharge tubes. It is depicted
in Fig. 2.1. A cathode ray tube is made of
glass containing two thin pieces of metal,
called electrodes, sealed in it. The electrical
discharge through the gases could be
observed only at very low pressures and at
very high voltages. The pressure of different
gases could be adjusted by evacuation of the
glass tubes. When sufficiently high voltage
is applied across the electrodes, current
starts flowing through a stream of particles
moving in the tube from the negative
electrode (cathode) to the positive electrode
(anode). These were called cathode rays or
cathode ray particles. The flow of current
from cathode to anode was further checked
by making a hole in the anode and coating
the tube behind anode with phosphorescent
material zinc sulphide. When these rays,
after passing through anode, strike the zinc
sulphide coating, a bright spot is developed
on the coating [Fig. 2.1(b)].

Fig. 2.1(b) A cathode ray discharge tube with
perforated anode

The results of these experiments are
summarised below.
(i)
The cathode rays start from cathode and
move towards the anode.
(ii) These rays themselves are not visible
but their behaviour can be observed
with the help of certain kind of materials
(fluorescent or phosphorescent) which
glow when hit by them. Television
picture tubes are cathode ray tubes
and television pictures result due to
fluorescence on the television screen
coated with certain fluorescent or
phosphorescent materials.
(iii) In the absence of electrical or magnetic
field, these rays travel in straight lines
(Fig. 2.2).
(iv) In the presence of electrical or magnetic
field, the behaviour of cathode rays are
similar to that expected from negatively
charged particles, suggesting that
the cathode rays consist of negatively
charged particles, called electrons.
(v) The characteristics of cathode rays
(electrons) do not depend upon the

31

structure of atom

material of electrodes and the nature of
the gas present in the cathode ray tube.
Thus, we can conclude that electrons are
basic constituent of all the atoms.
2.1.2	Charge to Mass Ratio of Electron
In 1897, British physicist J.J. Thomson
measured the ratio of electrical charge (e) to
the mass of electron (me ) by using cathode
ray tube and applying electrical and magnetic
field perpendicular to each other as well as
to the path of electrons (Fig. 2.2). When only
electric field is applied, the electrons deviate
from their path and hit the cathode ray tube
at point A (Fig. 2.2). Similarly when only
magnetic field is applied, electron strikes
the cathode ray tube at point C. By carefully
balancing the electrical and magnetic field
strength, it is possible to bring back the
electron to the path which is followed in the
absence of electric or magnetic field and they
hit the screen at point B. Thomson argued
that the amount of deviation of the particles
from their path in the presence of electrical
or magnetic field depends upon:
(i)
the magnitude of the negative charge on
the particle, greater the magnitude of
the charge on the particle, greater is the
interaction with the electric or magnetic
field and thus greater is the deflection.
(ii)

the mass of the particle — lighter the
particle, greater the deflection.

Fig. 2.2

(iii)

the strength of the electrical or magnetic
field — the deflection of electrons from its
original path increases with the increase
in the voltage across the electrodes, or
the strength of the magnetic field.

By carrying out accurate measurements
on the amount of deflections observed by
the electrons on the electric field strength or
magnetic field strength, Thomson was able to
determine the value of e/me as:
= 1.758820 × 1011 C kg–1

(2.1)

Where me is the mass of the electron in kg
and e is the magnitude of the charge on the
electron in coulomb (C). Since electrons are
negatively charged, the charge on electron
is –e.
2.1.3 Charge on the Electron
R.A. Millikan (1868-1953) devised a method
known as oil drop experiment (1906-14),
to determine the charge on the electrons.
He found the charge on the electron to be
– 1.6 × 10–19 C. The present accepted value of
electrical charge is – 1.602176 × 10–19 C. The
mass of the electron (me) was determined by
combining these results with Thomson’s value
of e/me ratio.

2.1.4 Discovery of Protons and Neutrons
Electrical discharge carried out in the modified
cathode ray tube led to the discovery of canal
rays carrying positively charged particles. The
characteristics of these positively charged
particles are listed below.
(i)
Unlike cathode rays, mass of positively
charged particles depends upon the
nature of gas present in the cathode
ray tube. These are simply the positively
charged gaseous ions.
(ii) The charge to mass ratio of the particles
depends on the gas from which these
originate.
(iii) Some of the positively charged particles
carry a multiple of the fundamental unit
of electrical charge.
(iv) The behaviour of these particles in the
magnetic or electrical field is opposite
to that observed for electron or cathode
rays.

Millikan’s Oil Drop Method
In this method, oil droplets in the form of
mist, produced by the atomiser, were allowed
to enter through a tiny hole in the upper
plate of electrical condenser. The downward
motion of these droplets was viewed through
the telescope, equipped with a micrometer
eye piece. By measuring the rate of fall of
these droplets, Millikan was able to measure
the mass of oil droplets. The air inside the
chamber was ionized by passing a beam of
X-rays through it. The electrical charge on
these oil droplets was acquired by collisions
with gaseous ions. The fall of these charged
oil droplets can be retarded, accelerated or
made stationary depending upon the charge
on the droplets and the polarity and strength
of the voltage applied to the plate. By
carefully measuring the effects of electrical
field strength on the motion of oil droplets,
Millikan concluded that the magnitude of
electrical charge, q, on the droplets is always
an integral multiple of the electrical charge,
e, that is, q = n e, where n = 1, 2, 3... .

The smallest and lightest positive ion
was obtained from hydrogen and was called
proton. This positively charged particle was
characterised in 1919. Later, a need was felt
for the presence of electrically neutral particle
as one of the constituent of atom. These
particles were discovered by Chadwick (1932)
by bombarding a thin sheet of beryllium
by α-particles. When electrically neutral
particles having a mass slightly greater than
that of protons were emitted. He named
these particles as neutrons. The important
properties of all these fundamental particles
are given in Table 2.1.
2.2	Atomic Models
Observations obtained from the experiments
mentioned in the previous sections have
suggested that Dalton’s indivisible atom is
composed of sub-atomic particles carrying
positive and negative charges. The major
problems before the scientists after the
discovery of sub-atomic particles were:
• to account for the stability of atom,
• to compare the behaviour of elements
in terms of both physical and chemical
properties,

to explain the formation of different
kinds of molecules by the combination of
different atoms and,
to understand the origin and nature of
the characteristics of electromagnetic
radiation absorbed or emitted by atoms.

Different atomic models were proposed
to explain the distributions of these charged
particles in an atom. Although some of these
models were not able to explain the stability
of atoms, two of these models, one proposed
by J.J. Thomson and the other proposed by
Ernest Rutherford are discussed below.
2.2.1 Thomson Model of Atom
J. J. Thomson, in 1898, proposed that an
atom possesses a spherical shape (radius
approximately 10–10 m) in which the positive
charge is uniformly distributed. The electrons
are embedded into it in such a manner as to
give the most stable electrostatic arrangement
(Fig. 2.4). Many different names are given
to this model, for example, plum pudding,
raisin pudding or watermelon. This model

Fig.2.4 Thomson model of atom

can be visualised as a pudding or watermelon
of positive charge with plums or seeds
(electrons) embedded into it. An important
feature of this model is that the mass of the
atom is assumed to be uniformly distributed
over the atom. Although this model was able
to explain the overall neutrality of the atom,
but was not consistent with the results of later
experiments. Thomson was awarded Nobel
Prize for physics in 1906, for his theoretical
and experimental investigations on the
conduction of electricity by gases.

In the later half of the nineteenth century
different kinds of rays were discovered,
besides those mentioned earlier. Wilhalm
Röentgen (1845-1923) in 1895 showed
that when electrons strike a material in
the cathode ray tubes, produce rays which
can cause fluorescence in the fluorescent
materials placed outside the cathode ray
tubes. Since Röentgen did not know the
nature of the radiation, he named them
X-rays and the name is still carried on. It was
noticed that X-rays are produced effectively
when electrons strike the dense metal anode,
called targets. These are not deflected by the
electric and magnetic fields and have a very
high penetrating power through the matter
and that is the reason that these rays are
used to study the interior of the objects.
These rays are of very short wavelengths
(∼0.1 nm) and possess electro-magnetic
character (Section 2.3.1).
Henri Becqueral (1852-1908) observed
that there are certain elements which emit
radiation on their own and named this
phenomenon as radioactivity and the
elements known as radioactive elements.
This field was developed by Marie Curie,
Piere Curie, Rutherford and Fredrick Soddy.
It was observed that three kinds of rays i.e.,
α, β- and γ-rays are emitted. Rutherford
found that α-rays consists of high energy
particles carrying two units of positive charge
and four unit of atomic mass. He concluded
that α- particles are helium nuclei as when αparticles combined with two electrons yielded
helium gas. β-rays are negatively charged

chemistry

particles similar to electrons. The γ-rays
are high energy radiations like X-rays, are
neutral in nature and do not consist of
particles. As regards penetrating power,
α-particles are the least, followed by β-rays
(100 times that of α–particles) and γ-rays
(1000 times of that α-particles).

2.2.2	Rutherford’s Nuclear Model of Atom
Rutherford and his students (Hans Geiger
and Ernest Marsden) bombarded very thin
gold foil with α–particles. Rutherford’s famous
–particle scattering experiment is

A. Rutherford’s scattering experiment

represented in Fig. 2.5. A stream of high
energy α–particles from a radioactive source
was directed at a thin foil (thickness ∼ 100 nm)
of gold metal. The thin gold foil had a circular
fluorescent zinc sulphide screen around it.
Whenever α–particles struck the screen, a
tiny flash of light was produced at that point.
The results of scattering experiment were
quite unexpected. According to Thomson
model of atom, the mass of each gold atom
in the foil should have been spread evenly
over the entire atom, and α–particles had
enough energy to pass directly through such a
uniform distribution of mass. It was expected
that the particles would slow down and
change directions only by a small angles as
they passed through the foil. It was observed
that:
(i)
most of the α–particles passed through
the gold foil undeflected.
(ii) a small fraction of the α–particles was
deflected by small angles.
(iii) a very few α–particles (∼1 in 20,000)
bounced back, that is, were deflected by
nearly 180°.
On the basis of the observations,
Rutherford drew the following conclusions
regarding the structure of atom:

B. Schematic molecular view of the gold foil
Fig. 2.5

Schematic view of Rutherford’s
scattering experiment. When a beam
of alpha () particles is “shot” at a thin
gold foil, most of them pass through
without much effect. Some, however,
are deflected.

(i)

Most of the space in the atom is empty as
most of the α–particles passed through
the foil undeflected.

(ii)

A few positively charged α–particles were
deflected. The deflection must be due
to enormous repulsive force showing
that the positive charge of the atom
is not spread throughout the atom as
Thomson had presumed. The positive
charge has to be concentrated in a very
small volume that repelled and deflected
the positively charged α–particles.

(iii)

Calculations by Rutherford showed that
the volume occupied by the nucleus
is negligibly small as compared to the
total volume of the atom. The radius of
the atom is about 10–10 m, while that of
nucleus is 10–15 m. One can appreciate
this difference in size by realising that if

a cricket ball represents a nucleus, then
the radius of atom would be about 5 km.

The total number of nucleons is termed as
mass number (A) of the atom.

On the basis of above observations and
conclusions, Rutherford proposed the nuclear
model of atom. According to this model:

mass number (A) = number of protons (Z )
+ number of
neutrons (n)
(2.4)
			

(i)

The positive charge and most of the mass
of the atom was densely concentrated in
extremely small region. This very small
portion of the atom was called nucleus
by Rutherford.

(ii)

The nucleus is surrounded by electrons
that move around the nucleus with a
very high speed in circular paths called
orbits. Thus, Rutherford’s model of atom
resembles the solar system in which the
nucleus plays the role of sun and the
electrons that of revolving planets.

2.2.4 Isobars and Isotopes
The composition of any atom can be
represented by using the normal element
symbol (X) with super-script on the left hand
side as the atomic mass number (A) and
subscript (Z ) on the left hand side as the
atomic number (i.e., AZ X).

(iii)

Electrons and the nucleus are held
together by electrostatic forces of
attraction.

2.2.3	Atomic Number and Mass Number
The presence of positive charge on the nucleus
is due to the protons in the nucleus. As
established earlier, the charge on the proton
is equal but opposite to that of electron. The
number of protons present in the nucleus is
equal to atomic number (Z ). For example, the
number of protons in the hydrogen nucleus
is 1, in sodium atom it is 11, therefore their
atomic numbers are 1 and 11 respectively.
In order to keep the electrical neutrality,
the number of electrons in an atom is equal
to the number of protons (atomic number,
Z ). For example, number of electrons in
hydrogen atom and sodium atom are 1 and
11 respectively.
Atomic number (Z) = number of protons in
the nucleus of an atom
			

= number of electrons

			

in a nuetral atom

(2.3)

While the positive charge of the nucleus
is due to protons, the mass of the nucleus,
due to protons and neutrons. As discussed
earlier protons and neutrons present in the
nucleus are collectively known as nucleons.

Isobars are the atoms with same mass
number but different atomic number for
example, 14
C and 14
N. On the other hand,
6
7
atoms with identical atomic number but
different atomic mass number are known
as Isotopes. In other words (according to
equation 2.4), it is evident that difference
between the isotopes is due to the presence
of different number of neutrons present in
the nucleus. For example, considering of
hydrogen atom again, 99.985% of hydrogen
atoms contain only one proton. This isotope is
called protium (11H). Rest of the percentage of
hydrogen atom contains two other isotopes,
the one containing 1 proton and 1 neutron
is called deuterium (12D, 0.015%) and the
other one possessing 1 proton and 2 neutrons
is called tritium (13T ). The latter isotope is
found in trace amounts on the earth. Other
examples of commonly occuring isotopes are:
carbon atoms containing 6, 7 and 8 neutrons
13
14
besides 6 protons ( 12
); chlorine
6 C, 6 C, 6 C
atoms containing 18 and 20 neutrons besides
35
37
17 protons ( 17
Cl, 17
Cl ).
Lastly an important point to mention
regarding isotopes is that chemical properties
of atoms are controlled by the number of
electrons, which are determined by the number
of protons in the nucleus. Number of neutrons
present in the nucleus have very little effect
on the chemical properties of an element.
Therefore, all the isotopes of a given element
show same chemical behaviour.

Solution
In this case, 80
, Z = 35, A = 80, species
35 Br
is neutral
Number of protons = number of electrons
= Z = 35
Number of neutrons = 80 – 35 = 45,
(equation 2.4)
Problem 2.2
The number of electrons, protons and
neutrons in a species are equal to 18, 16
and 16 respectively. Assign the proper
symbol to the species.
Solution
The atomic number is equal to
number of protons = 16. The element is
sulphur (S).
Atomic mass number = number of
protons + number of neutrons
= 16 + 16 = 32
Species is not neutral as the number of
protons is not equal to electrons. It is
anion (negatively charged) with charge
equal to excess electrons = 18 – 16 = 2.

Note : Before using the notation Z X,
find out whether the species is a neutral
atom, a cation or an anion. If it is a
neutral atom, equation (2.3) is valid, i.e.,
number of protons = number of electrons
= atomic number. If the species is an
ion, determine whether the number of
protons are larger (cation, positive ion)
or smaller (anion, negative ion) than the
number of electrons. Number of neutrons
is always given by A–Z, whether the
species is neutral or ion.
2.2.5 Drawbacks of Rutherford Model
As you have learnt above, Rutherford nuclear
model of an atom is like a small scale solar
system with the nucleus playing the role

of the massive sun and the electrons being
similar to the lighter planets. When classical
mechanics* is applied to the solar system, it
shows that the planets describe well-defined
orbits around the sun. The gravitational force
between the planets is given by the expression
 m1m 2 
 G. 2  where m1 and m2 are the masses,
r
r is the distance of separation of the masses
and G is the gravitational constant. The theory
can also calculate precisely the planetary
orbits and these are in agreement with the
experimental measurements.
The similarity between the solar system
and nuclear model suggests that electrons
should move around the nucleus in well
defined orbits. Further, the coulomb force
(kq1q2/r2 where q1 and q2 are the charges, r
is the distance of separation of the charges
and k is the proportionality constant) between
electron and the nucleus is mathematically
similar to the gravitational force. However,
when a body is moving in an orbit, it
undergoes acceleration even if it is moving
with a constant speed in an orbit because
of changing direction. So an electron in the
nuclear model describing planet like orbits
is under acceleration. According to the
electromagnetic theory of Maxwell, charged
particles when accelerated should emit
electromagnetic radiation (This feature does
not exist for planets since they are uncharged).
Therefore, an electron in an orbit will emit
radiation, the energy carried by radiation
comes from electronic motion. The orbit will
thus continue to shrink. Calculations show
that it should take an electron only 10–8 s
to spiral into the nucleus. But this does
not happen. Thus, the Rutherford model
cannot explain the stability of an atom.
If the motion of an electron is described on
the basis of the classical mechanics and
electromagnetic theory, you may ask that
since the motion of electrons in orbits is
leading to the instability of the atom, then
why not consider electrons as stationary

* Classical mechanics is a theoretical science based on Newton’s laws of motion. It specifies the laws of motion of macroscopic
objects.

structure of atom

around the nucleus. If the electrons were
stationary, electrostatic attraction between
the dense nucleus and the electrons would
pull the electrons toward the nucleus to
form a miniature version of Thomson’s model
of atom.
Another serious drawback of the
Rutherford model is that it says nothing
about distribution of the electrons around the
nucleus and the energies of these electrons.
2.3

Developments Leading to the
Bohr’s Model of Atom
Historically, results observed from the studies
of interactions of radiations with matter have
provided immense information regarding
the structure of atoms and molecules. Neils
Bohr utilised these results to improve upon
the model proposed by Rutherford. Two
developments played a major role in the
formulation of Bohr’s model of atom. These
were:
(i)
Dual character of the electromagnetic
radiation which means that radiations
possess both wave like and particle like
properties, and
(ii) Experimental results regarding atomic
spectra.

was developed in the early 1870’s by James
Clerk Maxwell, which was experimentally
confirmed later by Heinrich Hertz. Here, we
will learn some facts about electromagnetic
radiations.
James Maxwell (1870) was the first to
give a comprehensive explanation about the
interaction between the charged bodies and
the behaviour of electrical and magnetic
fields on macroscopic level. He suggested
that when electrically charged particle moves
under accelaration, alternating electrical and
magnetic fields are produced and transmitted.
These fields are transmitted in the forms
of waves called electromagnetic waves or
electromagnetic radiation.
Light is the form of radiation known from
early days and speculation about its nature
dates back to remote ancient times. In earlier
days (Newton) light was supposed to be made
of particles (corpuscules). It was only in the
19th century when wave nature of light was
established.
Maxwell was again the first to reveal that
light waves are associated with oscillating
electric and magnetic character (Fig. 2.6).

First, we will discuss about the duel nature
of electromagnetic radiations. Experimental
results regarding atomic spectra will be
discussed in Section 2.4.
2.3.1 Wave Nature of Electromagnetic
	Radiation
In the mid-nineteenth century, physicists
actively studied absorption and emission of
radiation by heated objects. These are called
thermal radiations. They tried to find out of
what the thermal radiation is made. It is now
a well-known fact that thermal radiations
consist of electromagnetic waves of various
frequencies or wavelengths. It is based on
a number of modern concepts, which were
unknown in the mid-nineteenth century.
First active study of thermal radiation laws
occured in the 1850’s and the theory of
electromagnetic waves and the emission of
such waves by accelerating charged particles

Fig.2.6

components of an electromagnetic
wave. These components have the
same wavelength, frequency, speed
and amplitude, but they vibrate in two
mutually perpendicular planes.

Although electromagnetic wave motion is
complex in nature, we will consider here only
a few simple properties.

particles are perpendicular to each
other and both are perpendicular to the
direction of propagation of the wave.
Simplified picture of electromagnetic
wave is shown in Fig. 2.6.
Unlike sound waves or waves produced
in water, electromagnetic waves do
not require medium and can move in
vacuum.
It is now well established that there
are many types of electromagnetic
radiations, which differ from one
another in wavelength (or frequency).
These constitute what is called
electromagnetic spectrum (Fig. 2.7).
Different regions of the spectrum are
identified by different names. Some
examples are: radio frequency region
around 106 Hz, used for broadcasting;
microwave region around 1010 Hz used
for radar; infrared region around 1013
Hz used for heating; ultraviolet region
around 1016Hz a component of sun’s
radiation. The small portion around 1015
Hz, is what is ordinarily called visible
light. It is only this part which our eyes
can see (or detect). Special instruments
are required to detect non-visible
radiation.

(iv)

Different kinds of units are used to
represent electromagnetic radiation.

These radiations are characterised by
the properties, namely, frequency (ν ) and
wavelength (λ).
The SI unit for frequency (ν) is hertz
(Hz, s–1), after Heinrich Hertz. It is defined as
the number of waves that pass a given point
in one second.
Wavelength should have the units of
length and as you know that the SI units of
length is meter (m). Since electromagnetic
radiation consists of different kinds of waves
of much smaller wavelengths, smaller units
are used. Fig. 2.7 shows various types of
electro-magnetic radiations which differ from
one another in wavelengths and frequencies.
In vaccum all types of electromagnetic
radiations, regardless of wavelength, travel at
the same speed, i.e., 3.0 × 108 m s–1 (2.997925
× 108 ms–1, to be precise). This is called speed
of light and is given the symbol ‘c’. The
frequency (ν ), wavelength (λ) and velocity of
light (c) are related by the equation (2.5).
c = ν λ

The other commonly used quantity
specially in spectroscopy, is the wavenumber
( ). It is defined as the number of wavelengths
per unit length. Its units are reciprocal of
wavelength unit, i.e., m–1. However commonly
used unit is cm–1 (not SI unit).
Problem 2.3
The Vividh Bharati station of All India
Radio, Delhi, broadcasts on a frequency
of 1,368 kHz (kilo hertz). Calculate
the wavelength of the electromagnetic
radiation emitted by transmitter. Which
part of the electromagnetic spectrum
does it belong to?
Solution
The wavelength, λ, is equal to c/ν, where
c is the speed of electromagnetic radiation
in vacuum and ν is the frequency.
Substituting the given values, we have

2.3.2 Particle Nature of Electromagnetic
	Radiation:
Planck’s
Quantum
	Theory
Some of the experimental phenomenon
such as diffraction* and interference** can
be explained by the wave nature of the
electromagnetic radiation. However, following
are some of the observations which could
not be explained with the help of even the
electromagentic theory of 19th century
physics (known as classical physics):
(i)
the nature of emission of radiation from
hot bodies (black-body radiation)
(ii) ejection of electrons from metal surface
when radiation strikes it (photoelectric
effect)
(iii) variation of heat capacity of solids as a
function of temperature

* Diffraction is the bending of wave around an obstacle.
** Interference is the combination of two waves of the same or different frequencies to give a wave whose distribution at each
point in space is the algebraic or vector sum of disturbances at that point resulting from each interfering wave.

(iv) Line spectra of atoms with special
reference to hydrogen.
These phenomena indicate that the system
can take energy only in discrete amounts.
All possible energies cannot be taken up or
radiated.
It is noteworthy that the first concrete
explanation for the phenomenon of the black
body radiation mentioned above was given
by Max Planck in 1900. Let us first try to
understand this phenomenon, which is given
below:
Ho t o b j e c t s e m i t e l e c t r o m a g n e t i c
radiations over a wide range of wavelengths.
At high temperatures, an appreciable
proportion of radiation is in the visible
region of the spectrum. As the temperature
is raised, a higher proportion of short
wavelength (blue light) is generated. For
example, when an iron rod is heated in a
furnace, it first turns to dull red and then
progressively becomes more and more red
as the temperature increases. As this is
heated further, the radiation emitted becomes
white and then becomes blue as the
temperature becomes very high. This means
that red radiation is most intense at a
particular temperature and the blue radiation
is more intense at another temperature. This
means intensities of radiations of different
wavelengths emitted by hot body depend
upon its temperature. By late 1850’s it was
known that objects made of different material
and kept at different temperatures emit
different amount of radiation. Also, when the
surface of an object is irradiated with light
(electromagnetic radiation), a part of radiant
energy is generally reflected as such, a part
is absorbed and a part of it is transmitted.
The reason for incomplete absorption is
that ordinary objects are as a rule imperfect
absorbers of radiation. An ideal body, which
emits and absorbs radiations of all frequencies
uniformly, is called a black body and the
radiation emitted by such a body is called
black body radiation. In practice, no such
body exists. Carbon black approximates
fairly closely to black body. A good physical
approximation to a black body is a cavity with a
tiny hole, which has no other opening. Any ray

entering the hole will be reflected by the cavity
walls and will be eventually absorbed by the
walls. A black body is also a perfect radiator of
radiant energy. Furthermore, a black body is
in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings.
It radiates same amount of energy per unit
area as it absorbs from its surrounding in
any given time. The amount of light emitted
(intensity of radiation) from a black body
and its spectral distribution depends only
on its temperature. At a given temperature,
intensity of radiation emitted increases
with the increase of wavelength, reaches a
maximum value at a given wavelength and
then starts decreasing with further increase of
wavelength, as shown in Fig. 2.8. Also, as the
temperature increases, maxima of the curve
shifts to short wavelength. Several attempts
were made to predict the intensity of radiation
as a function of wavelength.
But the results of the above experiment
could not be explained satisfactorily on
the basis of the wave theory of light. Max
Planck arrived at a satisfactory relationship

structure of atom

by making an assumption that absorption
and emmission of radiation arises from
oscillator i.e., atoms in the wall of black
body. Their frequency of oscillation is
changed by interaction with oscilators of
electromagnetic radiation. Planck assumed
that radiation could be sub-divided into
discrete chunks of energy. He suggested that
atoms and molecules could emit or absorb
energy only in discrete quantities and not
in a continuous manner. He gave the name
quantum to the smallest quantity of energy
that can be emitted or absorbed in the form
of electromagnetic radiation. The energy (E)
of a quantum of radiation is proportional
to its frequency (ν) and is expressed by
equation (2.6).
E = hυ
(2.6)
The proportionality constant, ‘h’ is known
as Planck’s constant and has the value
6.626×10–34 J s.
With this theory, Planck was able to explain
the distribution of intensity in the radiation
from black body as a function of frequency or
wavelength at different temperatures.
Quantisation has been compared to
standing on a staircase. A person can stand
on any step of a staircase, but it is not possible
for him/her to stand in between the two steps.
The energy can take any one of the values
from the following set, but cannot take on any
values between them.
E = 0, hυ, 2hυ , 3hυ....nhυ.....

Equipment for studying the photoelectric
effect. Light of a particular frequency
strikes a clean metal surface inside a
vacuum chamber. Electrons are ejected
from the metal and are counted by a
detector that measures their kinetic
energy.

Max Planck
(1858–1947)
Max Planck, a German physicist,
received his Ph.D in theoretical
physics from the University of
Munich in 1879. In 1888, he
was appointed Director of the
Institute of Theoretical Physics
at the University of Berlin.
Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics
in 1918 for his quantum theory. Planck also made
significant contributions in thermodynamics and
other areas of physics.

Photoelectric Effect
In 1887, H. Hertz performed a very interesting
experiment in which electrons (or electric
current) were ejected when certain metals
(for example potassium, rubidium, caesium
etc.) were exposed to a beam of light as shown
in Fig. 2.9. The phenomenon is called
Photoelectric effect. The results observed
in this experiment were:
The electrons are ejected from the metal
(i)
surface as soon as the beam of light
strikes the surface, i.e., there is no time
lag between the striking of light beam and
the ejection of electrons from the metal
surface.
(ii) The number of electrons ejected is
proportional to the intensity or brightness
of light.
(iii) For each metal, there is a characteristic
minimum frequency, ν 0 (also known
as threshold frequency) below which
photoelectric effect is not observed. At
a frequency ν >ν0, the ejected electrons
come out with certain kinetic energy.
The kinetic energies of these electrons
increase with the increase of frequency
of the light used.
All the above results could not be explained
on the basis of laws of classical physics.
According to latter, the energy content of the
beam of light depends upon the brightness of
the light. In other words, number of electrons
ejected and kinetic energy associated with
them should depend on the brightness of light.
It has been observed that though the number

of electrons ejected does depend upon the
brightness of light, the kinetic energy of the
ejected electrons does not. For example, red
light [ν = (4.3 to 4.6) × 1014 Hz] of any brightness
(intensity) may shine on a piece of potassium
metal for hours but no photoelectrons are
ejected. But, as soon as even a very weak
yellow light (ν = 5.1–5.2 × 1014 Hz) shines on
the potassium metal, the photoelectric effect
is observed. The threshold frequency (ν0) for
potassium metal is 5.0×1014 Hz.
Einstein (1905) was able to explain the
photoelectric effect using Planck’s quantum
theory of electromagnetic radiation as a
starting point.
Albert Einstein, a German born
American physicist, is regarded
by many as one of the two great
physicists the world has known
(the other is Isaac Newton). His
three research papers (on special
relativity, Brownian motion and
the photoelectric effect) which Albert Einstein
(1879–1955)
he published in 1905, while he
was employed as a technical
assistant in a Swiss patent office in Berne have
profoundly influenced the development of physics.
He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for
his explanation of the photoelectric effect.

Shining a beam of light on to a metal
surface can, therefore, be viewed as shooting
a beam of particles, the photons. When a
photon of sufficient energy strikes an electron
in the atom of the metal, it transfers its energy
instantaneously to the electron during the
collision and the electron is ejected without
any time lag or delay. Greater the energy
possessed by the photon, greater will be
transfer of energy to the electron and greater
the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. In
other words, kinetic energy of the ejected
electron is proportional to the frequency
of the electromagnetic radiation. Since the
striking photon has energy equal to hν and

the minimum energy required to eject the
electron is hν0 (also called work function,
W0 ; Table 2.2), then the difference in energy
(hν – hν0 ) is transferred as the kinetic energy of
the photoelectron. Following the conservation
of energy principle, the kinetic energy of the
ejected electron is given by the equation 2.7.
(2.7)
where me is the mass of the electron and v is the
velocity associated with the ejected electron.
Lastly, a more intense beam of light consists
of larger number of photons, consequently the
number of electrons ejected is also larger as
compared to that in an experiment in which a
beam of weaker intensity of light is employed.
Dual Behaviour
Radiation

of

Electromagnetic

The particle nature of light posed a dilemma for
scientists. On the one hand, it could explain
the black body radiation and photoelectric
effect satisfactorily but on the other hand,
it was not consistent with the known wave
behaviour of light which could account for the
phenomena of interference and diffraction.
The only way to resolve the dilemma was
to accept the idea that light possesses
both particle and wave-like properties, i.e.,
light has dual behaviour. Depending on
the experiment, we find that light behaves
either as a wave or as a stream of particles.
Whenever radiation interacts with matter, it
displays particle like properties in contrast
to the wavelike properties (interference
and diffraction), which it exhibits when it
propagates. This concept was totally alien to
the way the scientists thought about matter
and radiation and it took them a long time to
become convinced of its validity. It turns out,
as you shall see later, that some microscopic
particles like electrons also exhibit this waveparticle duality.

	Electronic Energy Levels: Atomic
spectra
The speed of light depends upon the nature
of the medium through which it passes. As a
result, the beam of light is deviated or refracted
from its original path as it passes from one
medium to another. It is observed that when
a ray of white light is passed through a prism,
the wave with shorter wavelength bends more
than the one with a longer wavelength. Since
ordinary white light consists of waves with
all the wavelengths in the visible range, a ray
of white light is spread out into a series of
coloured bands called spectrum. The light of
red colour which has longest wavelength is
deviated the least while the violet light, which
has shortest wavelength is deviated the most.
The spectrum of white light, that we can
see, ranges from violet at 7.50 × 1014 Hz to
red at 4×1014 Hz. Such a spectrum is called
continuous spectrum. Continuous because
violet merges into blue, blue into green and
so on. A similar spectrum is produced when
a rainbow forms in the sky. Remember that
visible light is just a small portion of the
electromagnetic radiation (Fig.2.7). When
electromagnetic radiation interacts with
matter, atoms and molecules may absorb
energy and reach to a higher energy state. With
higher energy, these are in an unstable state.
For returning to their normal (more stable,
lower energy states) energy state, the atoms
and molecules emit radiations in various
regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Emission and Absorption Spectra
The spectrum of radiation emitted by a
substance that has absorbed energy is called
an emission spectrum. Atoms, molecules or
ions that have absorbed radiation are said
to be “excited”. To produce an emission
spectrum, energy is supplied to a sample by
heating it or irradiating it and the wavelength
(or frequency) of the radiation emitted, as
the sample gives up the absorbed energy, is
recorded.
An absorption spectrum is like the
photographic negative of an emission

spectrum. A continuum of radiation is passed
through a sample which absorbs radiation of
certain wavelengths. The missing wavelength
which corresponds to the radiation absorbed
by the matter, leave dark spaces in the bright
continuous spectrum.
The study of emission or absorption
spectra is referred to as spectroscopy. The
spectrum of the visible light, as discussed
above, was continuous as all wavelengths (red
to violet) of the visible light are represented in
the spectra. The emission spectra of atoms in
the gas phase, on the other hand, do not show
a continuous spread of wavelength from red
to violet, rather they emit light only at specific
wavelengths with dark spaces between them.
Such spectra are called line spectra or
atomic spectra because the emitted radiation
is identified by the appearance of bright lines
in the spectra (Fig. 2.10 page 45).
Line emission spectra are of great
interest in the study of electronic structure.
Each element has a unique line emission
spectrum. The characteristic lines in atomic
spectra can be used in chemical analysis to
identify unknown atoms in the same way
as fingerprints are used to identify people.
The exact matching of lines of the emission
spectrum of the atoms of a known element
with the lines from an unknown sample
quickly establishes the identity of the latter,
German chemist, Robert Bunsen (1811-1899)
was one of the first investigators to use line
spectra to identify elements.
Elements like rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs)
thallium (Tl), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and
scandium (Sc) were discovered when their
minerals were analysed by spectroscopic
methods. The element helium (He) was
discovered in the sun by spectroscopic method.
Line Spectrum of Hydrogen
When an electric discharge is passed through
gaseous hydrogen, the H2 molecules dissociate
and the energetically excited hydrogen atoms
produced emit electromagnetic radiation of
discrete frequencies. The hydrogen spectrum
consists of several series of lines named after
their discoverers. Balmer showed in 1885
on the basis of experimental observations

* The restriction of any property to discrete values is called quantization.

Fig. 2.10 (a) Atomic emission. The light emitted by a sample of excited hydrogen atoms (or any other
element) can be passed through a prism and separated into certain discrete wavelengths. Thus an emission
spectrum, which is a photographic recording of the separated wavelengths is called as line spectrum. Any
sample of reasonable size contains an enormous number of atoms. Although a single atom can be in only
one excited state at a time, the collection of atoms contains all possible excited states. The light emitted as
these atoms fall to lower energy states is responsible for the spectrum. (b) Atomic absorption. When white
light is passed through unexcited atomic hydrogen and then through a slit and prism, the transmitted light
is lacking in intensity at the same wavelengths as are emitted in (a) The recorded absorption spectrum is
also a line spectrum and the photographic negative of the emission spectrum.

that if spectral lines are expressed in terms
of wavenumber ( ), then the visible lines of
the hydrogen spectrum obey the following
formula:
(2.8)
where n is an integer equal to or greater than
3 (i.e., n = 3,4,5,....)
The series of lines described by this formula
are called the Balmer series. The Balmer
series of lines are the only lines in the hydrogen
spectrum which appear in the visible region
of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Swedish
spectroscopist, Johannes Rydberg, noted
that all series of lines in the hydrogen
spectrum could be described by the following
expression :
(2.9)
where n1=1,2........
n2 = n1 + 1, n1 + 2......

The value 109,677 cm –1 is called the
Rydberg constant for hydrogen. The first five
series of lines that correspond to n1 = 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 are known as Lyman, Balmer, Paschen,
Bracket and Pfund series, respectively,
Table 2.3 shows these series of transitions in
the hydrogen spectrum. Fig. 2.11 (page, 46)
shows the Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series
of transitions for hydrogen atom.

atomic structure and spectra. Bohr’s model
for hydrogen atom is based on the following
postulates:
i)
The electron in the hydrogen atom can
move around the nucleus in a circular
path of fixed radius and energy. These
paths are called orbits, stationary states
or allowed energy states. These orbits
are arranged concentrically around the
nucleus.
The energy of an electron in the orbit
ii)
does not change with time. However,
the electron will move from a lower
stationary state to a higher stationary
state when required amount of energy
is absorbed by the electron or energy is
emitted when electron moves from higher
stationary state to lower stationary state
(equation 2.16). The energy change does
not take place in a continuous manner.
Angular Momentum
Just as linear momentum is the product
of mass (m) and linear velocity (v), angular
momentum is the product of moment of
inertia (I) and angular velocity (ω). For an
electron of mass me, moving in a circular
path of radius r around the nucleus,

hydrogen atom (The diagram shows the
Lyman, Balmer and Paschen series of
transitions)

becomes more and more complex for heavier
atom. There are, however, certain features
which are common to all line spectra, i.e.,
(i) line spectrum of element is unique and
(ii) there is regularity in the line spectrum of
each element. The questions which arise are:
What are the reasons for these similarities?
Is it something to do with the electronic
structure of atoms? These are the questions
need to be answered. We shall find later that
the answers to these questions provide the
key in understanding electronic structure of
these elements.
2.4	Bohr’s Model for Hydrogen
Atom
Neils Bohr (1913) was the first to explain
quantitatively the general features of the
structure of hydrogen atom and its spectrum.
He used Planck’s concept of quantisation
of energy. Though the theory is not the
modern quantum mechanics, it can still
be used to rationalize many points in the

angular momentum = I × ω

		

Since I = mer2, and ω = v/r where v is the
linear velocity,
∴angular momentum = mer2 × v/r = mevr

iii)

The frequency of radiation absorbed or
emitted when transition occurs between
two stationary states that differ in
energy by ∆E, is given by:
(2.10)

iv)

Where E1 and E2 are the energies of the
lower and higher allowed energy states
respectively. This expression is commonly
known as Bohr’s frequency rule.
The angular momentum of an electron
is quantised. In a given stationary state
it can be expressed as in equation (2.11)

m e v r  n.

n = 1,2,3.....
2

structure of atom

Where me is the mass of electron, v is the
velocity and r is the radius of the orbit in
which electron is moving.
Thus an electron can move only in those
orbits for which its angular momentum is
integral multiple of h/2π. That means angular
momentum is quantised. Radiation is emitted
or obsorbed only when transition of electron
takes place from one quantised value of
angular momentum to another. Therefore,
Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory does not
apply here that is why only certain fixed orbits
are allowed.
The details regarding the derivation of
energies of the stationary states used by Bohr,
are quite complicated and will be discussed in
higher classes. However, according to Bohr’s
theory for hydrogen atom:
a)
The stationary states for electron are
numbered n = 1,2,3.......... These integral
numbers (Section 2.6.2) are known as
Principal quantum numbers.
b)
The radii of the stationary states are
expressed as:
(2.12)
rn = n2 a0
where a0 = 52.9 pm. Thus the radius of
the first stationary state, called the Bohr
orbit, is 52.9 pm. Normally the electron
in the hydrogen atom is found in this
orbit (that is n=1). As n increases the
value of r will increase. In other words
the electron will be present away from
the nucleus.
c)
The most important property associated
with the electron, is the energy of its
stationary state. It is given by the
expression.

where RH is called Rydberg constant and
its value is 2.18×10–18 J. The energy of the
lowest state, also called as the ground state, is

energy of the stationary state for n = 2, will

be : E2 = –2.18×10–18J ( 2 ) = –0.545×10–18 J.

Niels Bohr
(1885–1962)
Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist
received his Ph.D. from the
University of Copenhagen in
1911. He then spent a year
with J.J. Thomson and Ernest
Rutherford in England. In 1913,
he returned to Copenhagen where he remained for
the rest of his life. In 1920 he was named Director
of the Institute of theoretical Physics. After first
World War, Bohr worked energetically for peaceful
uses of atomic energy. He received the first Atoms
for Peace award in 1957. Bohr was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922.

Fig. 2.11 depicts the energies of different
stationary states or energy levels of hydrogen
atom. This representation is called an energy
level diagram.
When the electron is free from the influence
of nucleus, the energy is taken as zero. The
electron in this situation is associated with the
stationary state of Principal Quantum number
= n = ∞ and is called as ionized hydrogen atom.
When the electron is attracted by the nucleus
and is present in orbit n, the energy is emitted
and its energy is lowered. That is the reason
What does the negative electronic
energy (En) for hydrogen atom mean?
The energy of the electron in a hydrogen
atom has a negative sign for all possible
orbits (eq. 2.13). What does this negative
sign convey? This negative sign means
that the energy of the electron in the
atom is lower than the energy of a free
electron at rest. A free electron at rest
is an electron that is infinitely far away
from the nucleus and is assigned the
energy value of zero. Mathematically, this
corresponds to setting n equal to infinity
in the equation (2.13) so that E∞=0. As the
electron gets closer to the nucleus (as n
decreases), En becomes larger in absolute
value and more and more negative. The
most negative energy value is given by
n=1 which corresponds to the most stable
orbit. We call this the ground state.

for the presence of negative sign in equation
(2.13) and depicts its stability relative to the
reference state of zero energy and n = ∞.
d)
Bohr’s theory can also be applied to
the ions containing only one electron,
similar to that present in hydrogen
atom. For example, He+ Li2+, Be3+ and so
on. The energies of the stationary states
associated with these kinds of ions (also
known as hydrogen like species) are
given by the expression.

where Z is the atomic number and has
values 2,3 for the helium and lithium atoms
respectively. From the above equations, it is
evident that the value of energy becomes more
negative and that of radius becomes smaller
with increase of Z. This means that electron
will be tightly bound to the nucleus.
e)
It is also possible to calculate the
velocities of electrons moving in these
orbits. Although the precise equation
is not given here, qualitatively the
magnitude of velocity of electron
increases with increase of positive
charge on the nucleus and decreases
with increase of principal quantum
number.

2.4.1	Explanation of Line Spectrum of
Hydrogen
Line spectrum observed in case of hydrogen
atom, as mentioned in section 2.3.3, can be
explained quantitatively using Bohr’s model.
According to assumption 2, radiation (energy)
is absorbed if the electron moves from the
orbit of smaller Principal quantum number to
the orbit of higher Principal quantum number,
whereas the radiation (energy) is emitted if
the electron moves from higher orbit to lower
orbit. The energy gap between the two orbits
is given by equation (2.16)

In case of absorption spectrum, nf > ni and
the term in the parenthesis is positive and
energy is absorbed. On the other hand in case
of emission spectrum ni > nf , ∆ E is negative
and energy is released.
The expression (2.17) is similar to that
used by Rydberg (2.9) derived empirically
using the experimental data available at that
time. Further, each spectral line, whether
in absorption or emission spectrum, can
be associated to the particular transition in
hydrogen atom. In case of large number of
hydrogen atoms, different possible transitions
can be observed and thus leading to large
number of spectral lines. The brightness or
intensity of spectral lines depends upon the
number of photons of same wavelength or
frequency absorbed or emitted.

2.4.2	Limitations of Bohr’s Model
Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom was no
doubt an improvement over Rutherford’s
nuclear model, as it could account for the
stability and line spectra of hydrogen atom
and hydrogen like ions (for example, He+, Li2+,
Be3+, and so on). However, Bohr’s model was
too simple to account for the following points.
i)
It fails to account for the finer details
(doublet, that is two closely spaced lines)
of the hydrogen atom spectrum observed
by using sophisticated spectroscopic
techniques. This model is also unable
to explain the spectrum of atoms
other than hydrogen, for example,
helium atom which possesses only two
electrons. Further, Bohr’s theory was
also unable to explain the splitting
of spectral lines in the presence of
magnetic field (Zeeman effect) or an
electric field (Stark effect).
It could not explain the ability of atoms
ii)
to form molecules by chemical bonds.

2.5	Towards Quantum Mechanical
Model of the Atom
In view of the shortcoming of the Bohr’s
model, attempts were made to develop a more
suitable and general model for atoms. Two
important developments which contributed
significantly in the formulation of such a
model were:
1.  Dual behaviour of matter,
2. Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
2.5.1 Dual Behaviour of Matter
The French physicist, de Broglie, in 1924
proposed that matter, like radiation, should
also exhibit dual behaviour i.e., both particle
and wavelike properties. This means that
just as the photon has momentum as well
as wavelength, electrons should also have
momentum as well as wavelength, de Broglie,
from this analogy, gave the following relation
between wavelength (λ) and momentum (p) of
a material particle.

Louis de Broglie
(1892 – 1987)
Louis de Broglie, a French
physicist, studied history
as an undergraduate in the
early 1910’s. His interest
turned to science as a result
of his assignment to radio
communications in World
War I. He received his
Dr. Sc. from the University of Paris in 1924.
He was professor of theoretical physics at
the University of Paris from 1932 untill his
retirement in 1962. He was awarded the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929.

where m is the mass of the particle, v its

prediction was confirmed experimentally when
it was found that an electron beam undergoes
diffraction, a phenomenon characteristic of
waves. This fact has been put to use in making
an electron microscope, which is based on
the wavelike behaviour of electrons just as an
ordinary microscope utilises the wave nature
of light. An electron microscope is a powerful
tool in modern scientific research because it
achieves a magnification of about 15 million
times.
It needs to be noted that according to de
Broglie, every object in motion has a wave
character. The wavelengths associated with
ordinary objects are so short (because of their
large masses) that their wave properties cannot
be detected. The wavelengths associated with
electrons and other subatomic particles (with
very small mass) can however be detected
experimentally. Results obtained from
the following problems prove these points
qualitatively.

2.5.2 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
Werner Heisenberg a German physicist in
1927, stated uncertainty principle which is
the consequence of dual behaviour of matter
and radiation. It states that it is impossible
to determine simultaneously, the exact
position and exact momentum (or velocity)
of an electron.
Mathematically, it can be given as in
equation (2.23).

(2.23)

where ∆x is the uncertainty in position and
∆px (or ∆vx ) is the uncertainty in momentum
(or velocity) of the particle. If the position of
the electron is known with high degree of
accuracy (∆x is small), then the velocity of the
electron will be uncertain [∆(vx) is large]. On
the other hand, if the velocity of the electron
is known precisely (∆(vx ) is small), then the
position of the electron will be uncertain
(∆x will be large). Thus, if we carry out some
physical measurements on the electron’s
position or velocity, the outcome will always
depict a fuzzy or blur picture.
The uncertainty principle can be best
understood with the help of an example.
Suppose you are asked to measure the
thickness of a sheet of paper with an
unmarked metrestick. Obviously, the results
obtained would be extremely inaccurate
and meaningless. In order to obtain any
accuracy, you should use an instrument
graduated in units smaller than the thickness
of a sheet of the paper. Analogously, in order
to determine the position of an electron, we
must use a meterstick calibrated in units of
smaller than the dimensions of electron (keep
in mind that an electron is considered as a
point charge and is therefore, dimensionless).
To observe an electron, we can illuminate it
with “light” or electromagnetic radiation. The
“light” used must have a wavelength smaller
than the dimensions of an electron. The high

would change the energy of electrons by
collisions. In this process we, no doubt,
would be able to calculate the position of the
electron, but we would know very little about
the velocity of the electron after the collision.
Significance of Uncertainty Principle
One of the important implications of the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that it
rules out existence of definite paths or
trajectories of electrons and other similar
particles. The trajectory of an object is
determined by its location and velocity at
various moments. If we know where a body
is at a particular instant and if we also know
its velocity and the forces acting on it at that
instant, we can tell where the body would
be sometime later. We, therefore, conclude
that the position of an object and its velocity
fix its trajectory. Since for a sub-atomic
object such as an electron, it is not possible
simultaneously to determine the position and
velocity at any given instant to an arbitrary
degree of precision, it is not possible to talk
of the trajectory of an electron.
The effect of Heisenberg Uncertainty
Principle is significant only for motion of
microscopic objects and is negligible for
that of macroscopic objects. This can be
seen from the following examples.
If uncertainty principle is applied to an
object of mass, say about a milligram (10–6 kg),
then

Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976) Werner Heisenberg (1901 – 1976) received his Ph.D. in
physics from the University of Munich in 1923. He then spent a year working with Max
Born at Gottingen and three years with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. He was professor of
physics at the University of Leipzig from 1927 to 1941. During World War II, Heisenberg
was in charge of German research on the atomic bomb. After the war he was named
director of Max Planck Institute for physics in Gottingen. He was also accomplished
mountain climber. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932.

The value of ∆v∆x obtained is extremely
small and is insignificant. Therefore, one
may say that in dealing with milligramsized or heavier objects, the associated
uncertainties are hardly of any real
consequence.
In the case of a microscopic object like an
electron on the other hand. ∆v.∆x obtained is
much larger and such uncertainties are of real
consequence. For example, for an electron
whose mass is 9.11×10–31 kg., according to
Heisenberg uncertainty principle

= 0.579×107 m s–1 (1J = 1 kg m2 s–2)
= 5.79×106 m s–1
Problem 2.16
A golf ball has a mass of 40g, and a speed
of 45 m/s. If the speed can be measured
within accuracy of 2%, calculate the
uncertainty in the position.
Solution
The uncertainty in the speed is 2%, i.e.,

It, therefore, means that if one tries to
find the exact location of the electron, say
to an uncertainty of only 10–8 m, then the
uncertainty ∆v in velocity would be

10 4 m 2 s 1
 104 ms 1
8
10 m
which is so large that the classical picture
of electrons moving in Bohr’s orbits (fixed)
cannot hold good. It, therefore, means that
the precise statements of the position
and momentum of electrons have to be
replaced by the statements of probability,
that the electron has at a given position
and momentum. This is what happens in
the quantum mechanical model of atom.
Problem 2.15
A microscope using suitable photons is
employed to locate an electron in an atom
within a distance of 0.1 Å. What is the
uncertainty involved in the measurement
of its velocity?
Solution
∆ x ∆p =

or ∆ x m ∆ v

Using the equation (2.22)

= 1.46×10–33 m
This is nearly ~ 10 18 times smaller
than the diameter of a typical atomic
nucleus. As mentioned earlier for large
particles, the uncertainty principle sets
no meaningful limit to the precision of
measurements.
Reasons for the Failure of the Bohr Model
One can now understand the reasons for the
failure of the Bohr model. In Bohr model,
an electron is regarded as a charged particle
moving  in well defined circular orbits about
the nucleus. The wave character of the
electron is not considered in Bohr model.
Further, an orbit is a clearly defined path
and this path can completely be defined
only if both the position and the velocity of
the electron are known exactly at the same
time. This is not possible according to the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr model
of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only
ignores dual behaviour of matter but also
contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

structure of atom

Erwin Schrödinger, an
Austrian physicist received
his Ph.D. in theoretical
physics from the University
of Vienna in 1910. In 1927
Schrödinger succeeded Max
Planck at the University of
Berlin at Planck’s request.
In 1933, Schrödinger left
B e r l i n b e c a u s e o f h i s Erwin Schrödinger
opposition to Hitler and
(1887–1961)
Nazi policies and returned
to Austria in 1936. After the invasion of Austria
by Germany, Schrödinger was forcibly removed
from his professorship. He then moved to Dublin,
Ireland where he remained for seventeen years.
Schrödinger shared the Nobel Prize for Physics
with P.A.M. Dirac in 1933.

In view of these inherent weaknesses in the
Bohr model, there was no point in extending
Bohr model to other atoms. In fact an insight
into the structure of the atom was needed
which could account for wave-particle duality
of matter and be consistent with Heisenberg
uncertainty principle. This came with the
advent of quantum mechanics.
2.6

Quantum Mechanical Model of
Atom
Classical mechanics, based on Newton’s
laws of motion, successfully describes the
motion of all macroscopic objects such as a
falling stone, orbiting planets etc., which have
essentially a particle-like behaviour as shown
in the previous section. However it fails when
applied to microscopic objects like electrons,
atoms, molecules etc. This is mainly because
of the fact that classical mechanics ignores
the concept of dual behaviour of matter
especially for sub-atomic particles and the
uncertainty principle. The branch of science
that takes into account this dual behaviour
of matter is called quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanics is a theoretical
science that deals with the study of the
motions of the microscopic objects that have
both observable wave like and particle like
properties. It specifies the laws of motion that

these objects obey. When quantum mechanics
is applied to macroscopic objects (for which
wave like properties are insignificant) the
results are the same as those from the
classical mechanics.
Quantum mechanics was developed
independently in 1926 by Werner Heisenberg
and Erwin Schrödinger. Here, however, we
shall be discussing the quantum mechanics
which is based on the ideas of wave motion.
The fundamental equation of quantum
mechanics was developed by Schrödinger
and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in
1933. This equation which incorporates waveparticle duality of matter as proposed by de
Broglie is quite complex and knowledge of
higher mathematics is needed to solve it. You
will learn its solutions for different systems
in higher classes.
For a system (such as an atom or a
molecule whose energy does not change with
time) the Schrödinger equation is written
where
is a mathematical
as
operator called Hamiltonian. Schrödinger
gave a recipe of constructing this operator
from the expression for the total energy of
the system. The total energy of the system
takes into account the kinetic energies of all
the sub-atomic particles (electrons, nuclei),
attractive potential between the electrons
and nuclei and repulsive potential among the
electrons and nuclei individually. Solution of
this equation gives E and ψ.
Hydrogen Atom and the Schrödinger
Equation
When Schrödinger equation is solved for
hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible
energy levels the electron can occupy and
the corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) of
the electron associated with each energy
level. These quantized energy states and
corresponding wave functions which are
characterized by a set of three quantum
numbers (principal quantum number
n, azimuthal quantum number l and
magnetic quantum number m l ) arise as a
natural consequence in the solution of the
Schrödinger equation. When an electron
is in any energy state, the wave function

54

chemistry

corresponding to that energy state contains
all information about the electron. The wave
function is a mathematical function whose
value depends upon the coordinates of the
electron in the atom and does not carry any
physical meaning. Such wave functions of
hydrogen or hydrogen like species with one
electron are called atomic orbitals. Such
wave functions pertaining to one-electron
species are called one-electron systems. The
probability of finding an electron at a point
within an atom is proportional to the |ψ|2 at
that point. The quantum mechanical results
of the hydrogen atom successfully predict
all aspects of the hydrogen atom spectrum
including some phenomena that could not be
explained by the Bohr model.

Application of Schrödinger equation to
multi-electron atoms presents a difficulty: the
Schrödinger equation cannot be solved exactly
for a multi-electron atom. This difficulty can
be overcome by using approximate methods.
Such calculations with the aid of modern
computers show that orbitals in atoms other
than hydrogen do not differ in any radical
way from the hydrogen orbitals discussed
above. The principal difference lies in the
consequence of increased nuclear charge.
Because of this all the orbitals are somewhat
contracted. Further, as you shall see later (in
subsections 2.6.3 and 2.6.4), unlike orbitals
of hydrogen or hydrogen like species, whose
energies depend only on the quantum number
n, the energies of the orbitals in multi-electron
atoms depend on quantum numbers n and l.
Important Features of the Quantum
Mechanical Model of Atom
Quantum mechanical model of atom is
the picture of the structure of the atom,
which emerges from the application of
the Schrödinger equation to atoms. The
following are the important features of the
quantum-mechanical model of atom:
1. The energy of electrons in atoms is
quantized (i.e., can only have certain
specific values), for example when
electrons are bound to the nucleus in
atoms.

5.

The existence of quantised electronic
energy levels is a direct result of the
wave like properties of electrons and
are allowed solutions of Schrödinger
wave equation.
Both the exact position and exact
velocity of an electron in an atom
cannot be determined simultaneously
(Heisenberg uncertainty principle). The
path of an electron in an atom therefore,
can never be determined or known
accurately. That is why, as you shall see
later on, one talks of only probability of
finding the electron at different points in
an atom.
An atomic orbital is the wave
function ψ for an electron in an atom.
Whenever an electron is described
by a wave function, we say that the
electron occupies that orbital. Since
many such wave functions are possible
for an electron, there are many atomic
orbitals in an atom. These “one electron
orbital wave functions” or orbitals form
the basis of the electronic structure
of atoms. In each orbital, the electron
has a definite energy. An orbital cannot
contain more than two electrons. In a
multi-electron atom, the electrons are
filled in various orbitals in the order of
increasing energy. For each electron
of a multi-electron atom, there shall,
therefore, be an orbital wave function
characteristic of the orbital it occupies.
All the information about the electron
in an atom is stored in its orbital wave
function ψ and quantum mechanics
makes it possible to extract this
information out of ψ.
The probability of finding an electron at
a point within an atom is proportional to
the square of the orbital wave function
i.e., |ψ|2 at that point. |ψ|2 is known
as probability density and is always
positive. From the value of |ψ|2 at
different points within an atom,
it is possible to predict the region
around the nucleus where electron
will most probably be found.

2.6.1	Orbitals and Quantum Numbers
A large number of orbitals are possible in
an atom. Qualitatively these orbitals can



Unit 2.indd 54

9/9/2022 4:28:17 PM

55

structure of atom

be distinguished by their size, shape and
orientation. An orbital of smaller size means
there is more chance of finding the electron
near the nucleus. Similarly shape and
orientation mean that there is more probability
of finding the electron along certain directions
than along others. Atomic orbitals are precisely
distinguished by what are known as quantum
numbers. Each orbital is designated by three
quantum numbers labelled as n, l and m l.
The principal quantum number ‘n’ is a
positive integer with value of n = 1,2,3.......
The principal quantum number determines
the size and to large extent the energy of the
orbital. For hydrogen atom and hydrogen like
species (He+, Li2+, .... etc.) energy and size of
the orbital depends only on ‘n’.

sub-shells in a principal shell is equal to the
value of n. For example in the first shell (n = 1),
there is only one sub-shell which corresponds
to l = 0. There are two sub-shells (l = 0, 1) in
the second shell (n = 2), three (l = 0, 1, 2) in
third shell (n = 3) and so on. Each sub-shell is
assigned an azimuthal quantum number (l).
Sub-shells corresponding to different values
of l are represented by the following symbols.
Value for l : 0 1 2 3 4 5 ............
notation for s p d f g h ............
sub-shell
Table 2.4 shows the permissible values of
‘l ’ for a given principal quantum number and
the corresponding sub-shell notation.
Table 2.4 Subshell Notations

The principal quantum number also
identifies the shell. With the increase in the
value of ‘n’, the number of allowed orbital
increases and are given by ‘n 2’ All the
orbitals of a given value of ‘n’ constitute
a single shell of atom and are represented
by the following letters
n = 1 2 3 4 ............
Shell = K L M N ............
Size of an orbital increases with increase of
principal quantum number ‘n’. In other words
the electron will be located away from the
nucleus. Since energy is required in shifting
away the negatively charged electron from the
positively charged nucleus, the energy of the
orbital will increase with increase of n.
Azimuthal quantum number. ‘l’ is also
known as orbital angular momentum or
subsidiary quantum number. It defines the
three-dimensional shape of the orbital. For a
given value of n, l can have n values ranging
from 0 to n – 1, that is, for a given value of n,
the possible value of l are : l = 0, 1, 2, ..........
(n–1)
For example, when n = 1, value of l is only
0. For n = 2, the possible value of l can be 0
and 1. For n = 3, the possible l values are 0,
1 and 2.
Each shell consists of one or more
sub-shells or sub-levels. The number of

Magnetic orbital quantum number.
‘m l’ gives information about the spatial
orientation of the orbital with respect to
standard set of co-ordinate axis. For any
sub-shell (defined by ‘l’ value) 2l+1 values of
ml are possible and these values are given by :
ml = – l, – (l –1), – (l – 2)... 0,1... (l – 2), (l–1), l
Thus for l = 0, the only permitted value
of ml = 0, [2(0)+1 = 1, one s orbital]. For l =
1, ml can be –1, 0 and +1 [2(1)+1 = 3, three p
orbitals]. For l = 2, ml = –2, –1, 0, +1 and +2,
[2(2)+1 = 5, five d orbitals]. It should be noted
that the values of ml are derived from l and
that the value of l are derived from n.

Each orbital in an atom, therefore, is
defined by a set of values for n, l and ml. An
orbital described by the quantum numbers
n = 2, l = 1, ml = 0 is an orbital in the p subshell of the second shell. The following chart

Electron spin ‘s’ : The three quantum
numbers labelling an atomic orbital can be
used equally well to define its energy, shape
and orientation. But all these quantum
numbers are not enough to explain the line
spectra observed in the case of multi-electron
atoms, that is, some of the lines actually occur
in doublets (two lines closely spaced), triplets
(three lines, closely spaced) etc. This suggests
the presence of a few more energy levels than
predicted by the three quantum numbers.
In 1925, George Uhlenbeck and Samuel
Goudsmit proposed the presence of the fourth
quantum number known as the electron
spin quantum number (ms ). An electron
spins around its own axis, much in a similar
way as earth spins around its own axis while
revolving around the sun. In other words,
an electron has, besides charge and mass,
intrinsic spin angular quantum number. Spin

angular momentum of the electron — a vector
quantity, can have two orientations relative to
the chosen axis. These two orientations are
distinguished by the spin quantum numbers
ms which can take the values of +½ or –½.
These are called the two spin states of the
electron and are normally represented by
two arrows, ↑ (spin up) and ↓ (spin down). Two
electrons that have different ms values (one +½
and the other –½) are said to have opposite
spins. An orbital cannot hold more than two
electrons and these two electrons should have
opposite spins.
To sum up, the four quantum numbers
provide the following information :
i)
n defines the shell,  determines the size
of the orbital and also to a large extent
the energy of the orbital.
There are n subshells in the nth shell. l
ii)
identifies the subshell and determines
the shape of the orbital (see section
2.6.2). There are (2l+1) orbitals of each
type in a subshell, that is, one s orbital
(l = 0), three p orbitals (l = 1) and five
d orbitals (l = 2) per subshell. To some
extent l also determines the energy of
the orbital in a multi-electron atom.
iii) ml designates the orientation of the
orbital. For a given value of l, ml has
(2l+1) values, the same as the number
of orbitals per subshell. It means that

Orbit, orbital and its importance
Orbit and orbital are not synonymous. An orbit, as proposed by Bohr, is a circular path around the
nucleus in which an electron moves. A precise description of this path of the electron is impossible
according to Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Bohr orbits, therefore, have no real meaning and
their existence can never be demonstrated experimentally. An atomic orbital, on the other hand,
is a quantum mechanical concept and refers to the one electron wave function ψ in an atom. It is
characterized by three quantum numbers (n, l and ml) and its value depends upon the coordinates
of the electron. ψ has, by itself, no physical meaning. It is the square of the wave function i.e., |ψ|2
which has a physical meaning. |ψ|2 at any point in an atom gives the value of probability density
at that point. Probability density (|ψ|2) is the probability per unit volume and the product of |ψ|2
and a small volume (called a volume element) yields the probability of finding the electron in that
volume (the reason for specifying a small volume element is that |ψ|2 varies from one region to
another in space but its value can be assumed to be constant within a small volume element).
The total probability of finding the electron in a given volume can then be calculated by the sum
of all the products of |ψ|2 and the corresponding volume elements. It is thus possible to get the
probable distribution of an electron in an orbital.

the number of orbitals is equal to the
number of ways in which they are
oriented.
iv)

ms refers to orientation of the spin of the
electron.
Problem 2.17
What is the total number of orbitals
associated with the principal quantum
number n = 3 ?
Solution
For n = 3, the possible values of l are
0, 1 and 2. Thus there is one 3s orbital
(n = 3, l = 0 and ml = 0); there are three
3p orbitals (n = 3, l = 1 and ml = –1, 0,
+1); there are five 3d orbitals (n = 3, l =
2 and ml = –2, –1, 0, +1+, +2).
Therefore, the total number of orbitals
is 1+3+5 = 9
The same value can also be obtained by
using the relation; number of orbitals
= n2, i.e. 32 = 9.
Problem 2.18
Using s, p, d, f notations, describe the
orbital with the following quantum
numbers
(a) n = 2, l = 1, (b) n = 4, l = 0, (c) n = 5,
l = 3, (d) n = 3, l = 2

2.6.2	Shapes of Atomic Orbitals
The orbital wave function or ψ for an electron
in an atom has no physical meaning. It
is simply a mathematical function of the
coordinates of the electron. However, for
different orbitals the plots of corresponding
wave functions as a function of r (the distance
from the nucleus) are different. Fig. 2.12(a),
gives such plots for 1s (n = 1, l = 0) and 2s
(n = 2, l = 0) orbitals.

Fig. 2.12 The plots of (a) the orbital wave
function ψ(r); (b) the variation of
probability density ψ2(r) as a function
of distance r of the electron from the
nucleus for 1s and 2s orbitals.

According to the German physicist,
Max Born, the square of the wave function
(i.e.,ψ 2) at a point gives the probability density
of the electron at that point. The variation
of ψ 2 as a function of r for 1s and 2s orbitals
is given in Fig. 2.12(b). Here again, you may
note that the curves for 1s and 2s orbitals
are different.
It may be noted that for 1s orbital the
probability density is maximum at the
nucleus and it decreases sharply as we move
away from it. On the other hand, for 2s
orbital the probability density first decreases
sharply to zero and again starts increasing.
After reaching a small maxima it decreases
again and approaches zero as the value of
r increases further. The region where this
probability density function reduces to zero
is called nodal surfaces or simply nodes.
In general, it has been found that ns-orbital
has (n – 1) nodes, that is, number of nodes
increases with increase of principal quantum
number n. In other words, number of nodes
for 2s orbital is one, two for 3s and so on.
These probability density variation can be
visualised in terms of charge cloud diagrams
[Fig. 2.13(a)]. In these diagrams, the density



Unit 2.indd 57

58

chemistry

of the dots in a region represents electron
probability density in that region.
Boundary surface diagrams of constant
probability density for different orbitals give
a fairly good representation of the shapes
of the orbitals. In this representation, a
boundary surface or contour surface is
drawn in space for an orbital on which the
value of probability density |ψ|2 is constant.
In principle many such boundary surfaces
may be possible. However, for a given
orbital, only that boundary surface diagram
of constant probability density* is taken to
be good representation of the shape of the
orbital which encloses a region or volume in
which the probability of finding the electron
is very high, say, 90%. The boundary surface
diagram for 1s and 2s orbitals are given in
Fig. 2.13(b). One may ask a question : Why
do we not draw a boundary surface diagram,
which bounds a region in which the probability
of finding the electron is, 100 %? The answer
to this question is that the probability density
| ψ | 2 has always some value, howsoever
small it may be, at any finite distance from
the nucleus. It is therefore, not possible to
draw a boundary surface diagram of a rigid
size in which the probability of finding the
electron is 100%. Boundary surface diagram
for a s orbital is actually a sphere centred on
the nucleus. In two dimensions, this sphere
looks like a circle. It encloses a region in
which probability of finding the electron is
about 90%.
Thus, we see that 1s and 2s orbitals are
spherical in shape. In reality all the s-orbitals
are spherically symmetric, that is, the
probability of finding the electron at a given
distance is equal in all the directions. It is also
observed that the size of the s orbital increases
with increase in n, that is, 4s > 3s > 2s > 1s
and the electron is located further away from
the nucleus as the principal quantum number
increases.
Boundary surface diagrams for three
2p orbitals (l = 1) are shown in Fig. 2.14. In

Fig. 2.13 (a) Probability density plots of 1s and
2s atomic orbitals. The density of the
dots represents the probability density
of finding the electron in that region.
(b) Boundary surface diagram for 1s
and 2s orbitals.

these diagrams, the nucleus is at the origin.
Here, unlike s-orbitals, the boundary surface
diagrams are not spherical. Instead each
p orbital consists of two sections called lobes
that are on either side of the plane that passes
through the nucleus. The probability density

* If probability density |ψ| is constant on a given surface, |ψ| is also constant over the surface. The boundary surface

for |ψ| and |ψ| are identical.

function is zero on the plane where the two
lobes touch each other. The size, shape and
energy of the three orbitals are identical.
They differ however, in the way the lobes are
oriented. Since the lobes may be considered to
lie along the x, y or z axis, they are given the
designations 2px, 2py, and 2pz. It should be
understood, however, that there is no simple
relation between the values of ml (–1, 0 and +1)
and the x, y and z directions. For our purpose,

it is sufficient to remember that, because
there are three possible values of m l, there
are, therefore, three p orbitals whose axes
are mutually perpendicular. Like s orbitals,
p orbitals increase in size and energy with
increase in the principal quantum number
and hence the order of the energy and size of
various p orbitals is 4p > 3p > 2p. Further, like
s orbitals, the probability density functions for
p-orbital also pass through value zero, besides
at zero and infinite distance, as the distance
from the nucleus increases. The number of
nodes are given by the n –2, that is number
of radial node is 1 for 3p orbital, two for 4p
orbital and so on.
For l = 2, the orbital is known as d-orbital
and the minimum value of principal quantum
number (n) has to be 3. as the value of l cannot
be greater than n–1. There are five ml values
(–2, –1, 0, +1 and +2) for l = 2 and thus there
are five d orbitals. The boundary surface
diagram of d orbitals are shown in Fig. 2.15.
The five d-orbitals are designated as dxy,
dyz, dxz, dx2–y2 and dz2. The shapes of the first
four d-orbitals are similar to each other, where
as that of the fifth one, dz2, is different from
others, but all five 3d orbitals are equivalent
in energy. The d orbitals for which n is greater
than 3 (4d, 5d...) also have shapes similar to
3d orbital, but differ in energy and size.
Besides the radial nodes (i.e., probability
density function is zero), the probability
density functions for the np and nd orbitals
are zero at the plane (s), passing through the
nucleus (origin). For example, in case of pz
orbital, xy-plane is a nodal plane, in case of
dxy orbital, there are two nodal planes passing
through the origin and bisecting the xy plane
containing z-axis. These are called angular
nodes and number of angular nodes are given
by ‘l’, i.e., one angular node for p orbitals, two
angular nodes for ‘d’ orbitals and so on. The
total number of nodes are given by (n–1),
i.e., sum of l angular nodes and (n – l – 1)
radial nodes.

The energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom
is determined solely by the principal quantum

number. Thus the energy of the orbitals in
hydrogen atom increases as follows :
1s < 2s = 2p < 3s = 3p = 3d <4s = 4p = 4d
= 4f <
(2.23)
and is depicted in Fig. 2.16. Although the
shapes of 2s and 2p orbitals are different,
an electron has the same energy when it is
in the 2s orbital as when it is present in 2p
orbital. The orbitals having the same energy
are called degenerate. The 1s orbital in a
hydrogen atom, as said earlier, corresponds
to the most stable condition and is called the
ground state and an electron residing in this
orbital is most strongly held by the nucleus.
An electron in the 2s, 2p or higher orbitals in
a hydrogen atom is in excited state.

Fig. 2.16 Energy level diagrams for the few
electronic shells of (a) hydrogen atom
and (b) multi-electronic atoms. Note that
orbitals for the same value of principal
quantum number, have the same
energies even for different azimuthal
quantum number for hydrogen atom.
In case of multi-electron atoms, orbitals
with same principal quantum number
possess different energies for different
azimuthal quantum numbers.

The energy of an electron in a multielectron atom, unlike that of the hydrogen
atom, depends not only on its principal
quantum number (shell), but also on its
azimuthal quantum number (subshell). That
is, for a given principal quantum number, s,
p, d, f ... all have different energies. Within
a given principal quantum number, the
energy of orbitals increases in the order
s<p<d<f. For higher energy levels, these
differences are sufficiently pronounced and
straggering of orbital energy may result,
e.g., 4s<3d and 6s<5d; 4f<6p. The main
reason for having different energies of the
subshells is the mutual repulsion among the
electrons in multi-electron atoms. The only
electrical interaction present in hydrogen
atom is the attraction between the negatively
charged electron and the positively charged
nucleus. In multi-electron atoms, besides the
presence of attraction between the electron
and nucleus, there are repulsion terms
between every electron and other electrons
present in the atom. Thus the stability of an
electron in a multi-electron atom is because
total attractive interactions are more than
the repulsive interactions. In general, the
repulsive interaction of the electrons in the
outer shell with the electrons in the inner shell
are more important. On the other hand, the
attractive interactions of an electron increases
with increase of positive charge (Ze) on the
nucleus. Due to the presence of electrons in
the inner shells, the electron in the outer shell
will not experience the full positive charge of
the nucleus (Ze). The effect will be lowered
due to the partial screening of positive charge
on the nucleus by the inner shell electrons.
This is known as the shielding of the outer
shell electrons from the nucleus by the
inner shell electrons, and the net positive
charge experienced by the outer electrons is
known as effective nuclear charge (Zeff e).
Despite the shielding of the outer electrons
from the nucleus by the inner shell electrons,
the attractive force experienced by the outer
shell electrons increases with increase of
nuclear charge. In other words, the energy of
interaction between, the nucleus and electron

structure of atom

(that is orbital energy) decreases (that is
more negative) with the increase of atomic
number (Z ).
Both the attractive and repulsive
interactions depend upon the shell and shape
of the orbital in which the electron is present.
For example electrons present in spherical
shaped, s orbital shields the outer electrons
from the nucleus more effectively as compared
to electrons present in p orbital. Similarly
electrons present in p orbitals shield the outer
electrons from the nucleus more than the
electrons present in d orbitals, even though all
these orbitals are present in the same shell.
Further within a shell, due to spherical shape
of s orbital, the s orbital electron spends more
time close to the nucleus in comparison to p
orbital electron which spends more time in
the vicinity of nucleus in comparison to d
orbital electron. In other words, for a given
shell (principal quantum number), the Zeff
experienced by the electron decreases with
increase of azimuthal quantum number (l),
that is, the s orbital electron will be more
tightly bound to the nucleus than p orbital
electron which in turn will be better tightly
bound than the d orbital electron. The energy
of electrons in s orbital will be lower (more
negative) than that of p orbital electron
which will have less energy than that of d
orbital electron and so on. Since the extent
of shielding from the nucleus is different for
electrons in different orbitals, it leads to the
splitting of energy levels within the same
shell (or same principal quantum number),
that is, energy of electron in an orbital, as
mentioned earlier, depends upon the values
of n and l. Mathematically, the dependence
of energies of the orbitals on n and l are quite
complicated but one simple rule is that, the
lower the value of (n + l) for an orbital, the
lower is its energy. If two orbitals have
the same value of (n + l), the orbital with
lower value of n will have the lower energy.
The Table 2.5 illustrates the (n + l ) rule and
Fig. 2.16 depicts the energy levels of multielectrons atoms. It may be noted that different
subshells of a particular shell have different
energies in case of multi-electrons atoms.
However, in hydrogen atom, these have the

Table 2.5	Arrangement of Orbitals with
Increasing Energy on the Basis
of (n+l ) Rule

same energy. Lastly it may be mentioned here
that energies of the orbitals in the same
subshell decrease with increase in the
atomic number (Zeff). For example, energy of
2s orbital of hydrogen atom is greater than
that of 2s orbital of lithium and that of lithium
is greater than that of sodium and so on, that
is, E2s(H) > E2s(Li) > E2s(Na) > E2s(K).
2.6.4 Filling of Orbitals in Atom
The filling of electrons into the orbitals of
different atoms takes place according to
the aufbau principle which is based on the
Pauli’s exclusion principle, the Hund’s rule
of maximum multiplicity and the relative
energies of the orbitals.
Aufbau Principle
The word ‘aufbau’ in German means ‘building
up’. The building up of orbitals means the



Unit 2.indd 61

62

chemistry

filling up of orbitals with electrons. The
principle states : In the ground state of the
atoms, the orbitals are filled in order of
their increasing energies. In other words,
electrons first occupy the lowest energy orbital
available to them and enter into higher energy
orbitals only after the lower energy orbitals
are filled. As you have learnt above, energy
of a given orbital depends upon effective
nuclear charge and different type of orbitals
are affected to different extent. Thus, there
is no single ordering of energies of orbitals
which will be universally correct for all atoms.
However, following order of energies of
the orbitals is extremely useful:
1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, 4f,
5d, 6p, 7s...
The order may be remembered by using
the method given in Fig. 2.17. Starting from

Fig.2.17 Order of filling of orbitals

the top, the direction of the arrows gives the
order of filling of orbitals, that is starting
from right top to bottom left. With respect to
placement of outermost valence electrons,
it is remarkably accurate for all atoms. for
example, valence electron in potassium
must choose between 3d and 4s orbitals and
as predicted by this sequence, it is found
in 4s orbital. The above order should be
assumed to be a rough guide to the filling
of energy levels. In many cases, the orbitals
are similar in energy and small changes in
atomic structure may bring about a change
in the order of filling. Even then, the above
series is a useful guide to the building of the
electronic structure of an atom provided that
it is remembered that exceptions may occur.
Pauli Exclusion Principle
The number of electrons to be filled in various
orbitals is restricted by the exclusion principle,
given by the Austrian scientist Wolfgang Pauli
(1926). According to this principle : No two
electrons in an atom can have the same set
of four quantum numbers. Pauli exclusion
principle can also be stated as : “Only two
electrons may exist in the same orbital and
these electrons must have opposite spin.”
This means that the two electrons can have
the same value of three quantum numbers
n, l and ml, but must have the opposite spin
quantum number. The restriction imposed
by Pauli’s exclusion principle on the number
of electrons in an orbital helps in calculating
the capacity of electrons to be present in any
subshell. For example, subshell 1s comprises
one orbital and thus the maximum number of
electrons present in 1s subshell can be two, in
p and d subshells, the maximum number of
electrons can be 6 and 10 and so on. This can
be summed up as : the maximum number
of electrons in the shell with principal
quantum number n is equal to 2n2.
Hund’s Rule of Maximum Multiplicity
This rule deals with the filling of electrons into
the orbitals belonging to the same subshell
(that is, orbitals of equal energy, called
degenerate orbitals). It states : pairing of



Unit 2.indd 62

9/9/2022 4:28:20 PM

63

structure of atom

electrons in the orbitals belonging to the
same subshell (p, d or f) does not take
place until each orbital belonging to that
subshell has got one electron each i.e., it
is singly occupied.
Since there are three p, five d and seven f
orbitals, therefore, the pairing of electrons will
start in the p, d and f orbitals with the entry
of 4th, 6th and 8th electron, respectively. It
has been observed that half filled and fully
filled degenerate set of orbitals acquire extra
stability due to their symmetry (see Section,
2.6.7).
2.6.5 Electronic Configuration of Atoms
The distribution of electrons into orbitals of an
atom is called its electronic configuration.
If one keeps in mind the basic rules which
govern the filling of different atomic orbitals,
the electronic configurations of different
atoms can be written very easily.
The electronic configuration of different
atoms can be represented in two ways. For
example :
(i) sa pbdc ...... notation

1s orbital. Its configuration is, therefore, 1s2.
As mentioned above, the two electrons differ
from each other with opposite spin, as can be
seen from the orbital diagram.

The third electron of lithium (Li) is not
allowed in the 1s orbital because of Pauli
exclusion principle. It, therefore, takes the
next available choice, namely the 2s orbital.
The electronic configuration of Li is 1s22s1.
The 2s orbital can accommodate one more
electron. The configuration of beryllium (Be)
atom is, therefore, 1s2 2s2 (see Table 2.6,
page 66 for the electronic configurations of
elements).
In the next six elements—boron
(B, 1s22s22p1), carbon (C, 1s22s22p2), nitrogen
(N, 1s22s22p3), oxygen (O, 1s22s22p4), fluorine
(F, 1s22s22p5) and neon (Ne, 1s22s22p6), the 2p
orbitals get progressively filled. This process
is completed with the neon atom. The orbital
picture of these elements can be represented
as follows :

(ii) Orbital diagram
s

p
d
In the first notation, the subshell is
represented by the respective letter symbol
and the number of electrons present in the
subshell is depicted, as the super script, like
a, b, c, ... etc. The similar subshell represented
for different shells is differentiated by writing
the principal quantum number before the
respective subshell. In the second notation
each orbital of the subshell is represented
by a box and the electron is represented by
an arrow (↑) a positive spin or an arrow (↓)
a negative spin. The advantage of second
notation over the first is that it represents all
the four quantum numbers.
The hydrogen atom has only one electron
which goes in the orbital with the lowest energy,
namely 1s. The electronic configuration of the
hydrogen atom is 1s1 meaning that it has
one electron in the 1s orbital. The second
electron in helium (He) can also occupy the

The electronic configuration of the
elements sodium (Na, 1s22s22p63s1) to argon
(Ar,1s22s22p63s23p6), follow exactly the same
pattern as the elements from lithium to neon
with the difference that the 3s and 3p orbitals
are getting filled now. This process can be
simplified if we represent the total number
of   electrons in the first two shells by the
name of element neon (Ne). The electronic
configuration of the elements from sodium to



Unit 2.indd 63

9/9/2022 4:28:21 PM

64

chemistry

argon can be written as (Na, [Ne]3s1) to (Ar,
[Ne] 3s23p6). The electrons in the completely
filled shells are known as core electrons and
the electrons that are added to the electronic
shell with the highest principal quantum
number are called valence electrons. For
example, the electrons in Ne are the core
electrons and the electrons from Na to Ar are
the valence electrons. In potassium (K) and
calcium (Ca), the 4s orbital, being lower in
energy than the 3d orbitals, is occupied by
one and two electrons respectively.
A new pattern is followed beginning with
scandium (Sc). The 3d orbital, being lower
in energy than the 4p orbital, is filled first.
Consequently, in the next ten elements,
scandium (Sc), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V),
chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe),
cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu) and zinc
(Zn), the five 3d orbitals are progressively
occupied. We may be puzzled by the fact
that chromium and copper have five and ten
electrons in 3d orbitals rather than four and
nine as their position would have indicated
with two-electrons in the 4s orbital. The
reason is that fully filled orbitals and halffilled orbitals have extra stability (that is,
lower energy). Thus p3, p6, d5, d10,f 7, f14 etc.
configurations, which are either half-filled
or fully filled, are more stable. Chromium
and copper therefore adopt the d 5 and
d 10 configuration (Section 2.6.7)[caution:
exceptions do exist]
With the saturation of the 3d orbitals,
the filling of the 4p orbital starts at gallium
(Ga) and is complete at krypton (Kr). In the
next eighteen elements from rubidium (Rb)
to xenon (Xe), the pattern of filling the 5s,
4d and 5p orbitals are similar to that of 4s,
3d and 4p orbitals as discussed above. Then
comes the turn of the 6s orbital. In caesium
(Cs) and the barium (Ba), this orbital contains
one and two electrons, respectively. Then from
lanthanum (La) to mercury (Hg), the filling up
of electrons takes place in 4f and 5d orbitals.

After this, filling of 6p, then 7s and finally 5f
and 6d orbitals takes place. The elements
after uranium (U) are all short-lived and all of
them are produced artificially. The electronic
configurations of the known elements (as
determined by spectroscopic methods) are
tabulated in Table 2.6 (page 66).
One may ask what is the utility of knowing
the electron configuration? The modern
approach to the chemistry, infact, depends
almost entirely on electronic distribution to
understand and explain chemical behaviour.
For example, questions like why two or more
atoms combine to form molecules, why some
elements are metals while others are nonmetals, why elements like helium and argon
are not reactive but elements like the halogens
are reactive, find simple explanation from the
electronic configuration. These questions have
no answer in the Daltonian model of atom.
A detailed understanding of the electronic
structure of atom is, therefore, very essential
for getting an insight into the various aspects
of modern chemical knowledge.
2.6.6	Stability of Completely Filled and
Half Filled Subshells
The ground state electronic configuration of
the atom of an element always corresponds to
the state of the lowest total electronic energy.
The electronic configurations of most of the
atoms follow the basic rules given in Section
2.6.5. However, in certain elements such as
Cu, or Cr, where the two subshells (4s and
3d) differ slightly in their energies, an electron
shifts from a subshell of lower energy (4s) to a
subshell of higher energy (3d), provided such
a shift results in all orbitals of the subshell
of higher energy getting either completely
filled or half filled. The valence electronic
configurations of Cr and Cu, therefore, are
3d5 4s1 and 3d10 4s1 respectively and not 3d4
4s2 and 3d9 4s2. It has been found that there is
extra stability associated with these electronic
configurations.

Causes of Stability of Completely Filled and Half-filled Subshells
The completely filled and completely
half-filled subshells are stable due to the
following reasons:
1. Symmetrical distribution of
electrons: It is well known that symmetry
leads to stability. The completely filled
or half filled subshells have symmetrical
distribution of electrons in them and
are therefore more stable. Electrons in
the same subshell (here 3d) have equal
energy but different spatial distribution.
Consequently, their shielding of oneanother is relatively small and the
electrons are more strongly attracted by
the nucleus.
2. Exchange Energy : The stabilizing
effect arises whenever two or more
electrons with the same spin are present
in the degenerate orbitals of a subshell.
These electrons tend to exchange their
positions and the energy released due to
this exchange is called exchange energy.
The number of exchanges that can take
place is maximum when the subshell
is either half filled or completely filled
(Fig. 2.18). As a result the exchange
energy is maximum and so is the stability.
You may note that the exchange
energy is at the basis of Hund’s rule
that electrons which enter orbitals of
equal energy have parallel spins as far
as possible. In other words, the extra
stability of half-filled and completely filled
subshell is due to: (i) relatively small
shielding, (ii) smaller coulombic repulsion
energy, and (iii) larger exchange energy.
Details about the exchange energy will be
dealt with in higher classes.

Summary
Atoms are the building blocks of elements. They are the smallest parts of an element that
chemically react. The first atomic theory, proposed by John Dalton in 1808, regarded atom as
the ultimate indivisible particle of matter. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, it was
proved experimentally that atoms are divisible and consist of three fundamental particles:
electrons, protons and neutrons. The discovery of sub-atomic particles led to the proposal
of various atomic models to explain the structure of atom.
Thomson in 1898 proposed that an atom consists of uniform sphere of positive electricity
with electrons embedded into it. This model in which mass of the atom is considered to
be evenly spread over the atom was proved wrong by Rutherford’s famous alpha-particle
scattering experiment in 1909. Rutherford concluded that atom is made of a tiny positively
charged nucleus, at its centre with electrons revolving around it in circular orbits.
Rutherford model, which resembles the solar system, was no doubt an improvement over
Thomson model but it could not account for the stability of the atom i.e., why the electron
does not fall into the nucleus. Further, it was also silent about the electronic structure of
atoms i.e., about the distribution and relative energies of electrons around the nucleus. The
difficulties of the Rutherford model were overcome by Niels Bohr in 1913 in his model of the
hydrogen atom. Bohr postulated that electron moves around the nucleus in circular orbits.
Only certain orbits can exist and each orbit corresponds to a specific energy. Bohr calculated
the energy of electron in various orbits and for each orbit predicted the distance between the
electron and nucleus. Bohr model, though offering a satisfactory model for explaining the
spectra of the hydrogen atom, could not explain the spectra of multi-electron atoms. The
reason for this was soon discovered. In Bohr model, an electron is regarded as a charged
particle moving in a well defined circular orbit about the nucleus. The wave character of
the electron is ignored in Bohr’s theory. An orbit is a clearly defined path and this path can
completely be defined only if both the exact position and the exact velocity of the electron
at the same time are known. This is not possible according to the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle. Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, therefore, not only ignores the dual behaviour
of electron but also contradicts Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, proposed an equation called Schrödinger equation to
describe the electron distributions in space and the allowed energy levels in atoms. This
equation incorporates de Broglie’s concept of wave-particle duality and is consistent with
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the electron in a
hydrogen atom, the solution gives the possible energy states the electron can occupy [and
the corresponding wave function(s) (ψ) (which in fact are the mathematical functions) of the
electron associated with each energy state]. These quantized energy states and corresponding
wave functions which are characterized by a set of three quantum numbers (principal
quantum number n, azimuthal quantum number l and magnetic quantum number ml)
arise as a natural consequence in the solution of the Schrödinger equation. The restrictions
on the values of these three quantum numbers also come naturally from this solution. The
quantum mechanical model of the hydrogen atom successfully predicts all aspects of the
hydrogen atom spectrum including some phenomena that could not be explained by the
Bohr model.
According to the quantum mechanical model of the atom, the electron distribution of an
atom containing a number of electrons is divided into shells. The shells, in turn, are thought
to consist of one or more subshells and subshells are assumed to be composed of one or
more orbitals, which the electrons occupy. While for hydrogen and hydrogen like systems
(such as He+, Li2+ etc.) all the orbitals within a given shell have same energy, the energy of
the orbitals in a multi-electron atom depends upon the values of n and l: The lower the value
of (n + l ) for an orbital, the lower is its energy. If two orbitals have the same (n + l ) value,
the orbital with lower value of n has the lower energy. In an atom many such orbitals are

possible and electrons are filled in those orbitals in order of increasing energy in accordance
with Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four
quantum numbers) and Hund’s rule of maximum multiplicity (pairing of electrons in the
orbitals belonging to the same subshell does not take place until each orbital belonging to
that subshell has got one electron each, i.e., is singly occupied). This forms the basis of the
electronic structure of atoms.

Classification of Elements and
Periodicity in Properties

After studying this Unit, you will be
able to

• appreciate how the concept of

grouping elements in accordance
to their properties led to the
development of Periodic Table.

• understand the Periodic Law;
• understand the   significance of
atomic number and electronic
configuration as the basis for
periodic classification;

• name the elements with
Z >100 according to IUPAC
nomenclature;

• classify elements into s, p, d,
f blocks and learn their main
characteristics;

• recognise the periodic trends in

physical and chemical properties
of elements;

• compare the reactivity of elements

and correlate it with their
occurrence in nature;

• explain the relationship between
ionization enthalpy and metallic
character;

• use

scientific vocabulary
appropriately to communicate
ideas related to certain important
properties of atoms e.g.,
atomic/ionic radii, ionization
enthalpy, electron gain enthalpy,
electronegativity, valence of
elements.

The Periodic Table is arguably the most important concept
in chemistry, both in principle and in practice. It is the
everyday support for students, it suggests new avenues
of research to professionals, and it provides a succinct
organization of the whole of chemistry. It is a remarkable
demonstration of the fact that the chemical elements are
not a random cluster of entities but instead display trends
and lie together in families. An awareness of the Periodic
Table is essential to anyone who wishes to disentangle
the world and see how it is built up from the fundamental
building blocks of the chemistry, the chemical elements.
Glenn T. Seaborg

In this Unit, we will study the historical development of the
Periodic Table as it stands today and the Modern Periodic
Law. We will also learn how the periodic classification
follows as a logical consequence of the electronic
configuration of atoms. Finally, we shall examine some of
the periodic trends in the physical and chemical properties
of the elements.
3.1 WHY DO WE NEED TO CLASSIFY ELEMENTS ?
We know by now that the elements are the basic units of
all types of matter. In 1800, only 31 elements were known.
By  1865, the number of identified elements had more than
doubled to 63. At present 114 elements are known. Of
them, the recently discovered elements are man-made.
Efforts to synthesise new elements are continuing. With
such a large number of elements it is very difficult to
study individually the chemistry of all these elements and
their innumerable compounds individually. To ease out
this problem, scientists searched for a systematic way to
organise their knowledge by classifying the elements. Not
only that it would rationalize known chemical facts about
elements, but even predict new ones for undertaking
further study.

Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties

3.2

GENESIS OF PERIODIC
CLASSIFICATION
Classification of elements into groups and
development of Periodic Law and Periodic
Table are the consequences of systematising
the knowledge gained by a number of
scientists through their observations and
experiments. The German chemist, Johann
Dobereiner in early 1800’s was the first to
consider the idea of trends among properties
of elements. By 1829 he noted a similarity
among the physical and chemical properties
of several groups of three elements (Triads). In
each case, he noticed that the middle element
of each of the Triads had an atomic weight
about half way between the atomic weights of
the other two (Table 3.1). Also the properties
of the middle element were in between those
of the other two members. Since Dobereiner’s

75

the periodic recurrence of properties. This
also did not attract much attention. The
English chemist, John Alexander Newlands
in 1865 profounded the Law of Octaves. He
arranged the elements in increasing order
of their atomic weights and noted that every
eighth element had properties similar to the
first element (Table 3.2). The relationship was
just like every eighth note that resembles the
first in octaves of music. Newlands’s Law of
Octaves seemed to be true only for elements
up to calcium. Although his idea was not
widely accepted at that time, he, for his work,
was later awarded Davy Medal in 1887 by the
Royal Society, London.
The Periodic Law, as we know it today
owes its development to the Russian chemist,
Dmitri Mendeleev (1834-1907) and the
German chemist, Lothar Meyer (1830-1895).

relationship, referred to as the Law of Triads,
seemed to work only for a few elements, it was
dismissed as coincidence. The next reported
attempt to classify elements was made by a
French geologist, A.E.B. de Chancourtois in
1862. He arranged the then known elements
in order of increasing atomic weights and
made a cylindrical table of elements to display

Working independently, both the chemists in
1869 proposed that on arranging elements in
the increasing order of their atomic weights,
similarities appear in physical and chemical
properties at regular intervals. Lothar Meyer
plotted the physical properties such as
atomic volume, melting point and boiling
point against atomic weight and obtained

a periodically repeated pattern. Unlike
Newlands, Lothar Meyer observed a change
in length of that repeating pattern. By 1868,
Lothar Meyer had developed a table of the
elements that closely resembles the Modern
Periodic Table. However, his work was not
published until after the work of Dmitri
Mendeleev, the scientist who is generally
credited with the development of the Modern
Periodic Table.
While Dobereiner initiated the study of
periodic relationship, it was Mendeleev who
was responsible for publishing the Periodic
Law for the first time. It states as follows :
The properties of the elements are
a periodic function of their atomic
weights.
Mendeleev arranged elements in horizontal
rows and vertical columns of a table in order
of their increasing atomic weights in such a
way that the elements with similar properties
occupied the same vertical column or group.
Mendeleev’s system of classifying elements
was more elaborate than that of Lothar
Meyer’s. He fully recognized the significance
of periodicity and used broader range of
physical and chemical properties to classify
the elements. In particular, Mendeleev relied
on the similarities in the empirical formulas
and properties of the compounds formed by
the elements. He realized that some of the
elements did not fit in with his scheme of

classification if the order of atomic weight
was strictly followed. He ignored the order
of atomic weights, thinking that the atomic
measurements might be incorrect, and placed
the elements with similar properties together.
For example, iodine with lower atomic weight
than that of tellurium (Group VI) was placed
in Group VII along with fluorine, chlorine,
bromine because of similarities in properties
(Fig. 3.1). At the same time, keeping his
primary aim of arranging the elements of
similar properties in the same group, he
proposed that some of the elements were
still undiscovered and, therefore, left several
gaps in the table. For example, both gallium
and germanium were unknown at the time
Mendeleev published his Periodic Table.
He left the gap under aluminium and a gap
under silicon, and called these elements
Eka-Aluminium and Eka-Silicon. Mendeleev
predicted not only the existence of gallium and
germanium, but also described some of their
general physical properties. These elements
were discovered later. Some of the properties
predicted by Mendeleev for these elements
and those found experimentally are listed in
Table 3.3.
The boldness of Mendeleev’s quantitative
predictions and their eventual success
made him and his Periodic Table famous.
Mendeleev’s Periodic Table published in 1905
is shown in Fig. 3.1.

3.3	MODERN PERIODIC LAW AND THE
PRESENT FORM OF THE PERIODIC
TABLE
We must bear in mind that when Mendeleev
developed his Periodic Table, chemists
knew nothing about the internal structure
of atom. However, the beginning of the 20th
century witnessed profound developments
in theories about sub-atomic particles. In
1913, the English physicist, Henry Moseley
observed regularities in the characteristic
X-ray spectra of the elements. A plot of
(where
is frequency of X-rays emitted)
against atomic number (Z) gave a straight
line and not the plot of
vs atomic mass.
He thereby showed that the atomic number
is a more fundamental property of an element
than its atomic mass. Mendeleev’s Periodic
Law was, therefore, accordingly modified. This
is known as the Modern Periodic Law and
can be stated as :
The physical and chemical properties
of the elements are periodic functions
of their atomic numbers.
The Periodic Law revealed important
analogies among the 94 naturally occurring
elements (neptunium and plutonium like
actinium and protoactinium are also found
in pitch blende – an ore of uranium). It
stimulated renewed interest in Inorganic
Chemistry and has carried into the present
with the creation of artificially produced
short-lived elements.
You may recall that the atomic number
is equal to the nuclear charge (i.e., number
of protons) or the number of electrons in
a neutral atom. It is then easy to visualize
the significance of quantum numbers and
electronic configurations in periodicity of
elements. In fact, it is now recognized that the
Periodic Law is essentially the consequence
of the periodic variation in electronic
configurations, which indeed determine the

physical and chemical properties of elements
and their compounds.
Numerous forms of Periodic Table have
been devised from time to time. Some
forms emphasise chemical reactions and
valence, whereas others stress the electronic
configuration of elements. A modern version,
the so-called “long form” of the Periodic
Table of the elements (Fig. 3.2), is the most
convenient and widely used. The horizontal
rows (which Mendeleev called series) are
called periods and the vertical columns,
groups. Elements having similar outer
electronic configurations in their atoms
are arranged in vertical columns, referred
to as groups or families. According to the
recommendation of International Union of
Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the
groups are numbered from 1 to 18 replacing
the older notation of groups IA … VIIA, VIII,
IB … VIIB and 0.
There are altogether seven periods. The
period number corresponds to the highest
principal quantum number (n) of the elements
in the period. The first period contains 2
elements. The subsequent periods consists of
8, 8, 18, 18 and 32 elements, respectively. The
seventh period is incomplete and like the sixth
period would have a theoretical maximum
(on the basis of quantum numbers) of 32
elements. In this form of the Periodic Table,
14 elements of both sixth and seventh periods
(lanthanoids and actinoids, respectively) are
placed in separate panels at the bottom*.
3.4	NOMENCLATURE OF ELEMENTS
WITH ATOMIC NUMBERS > 100
The naming of the new elements had been
traditionally the privilege of the discoverer
(or discoverers) and the suggested name was
ratified by the IUPAC. In recent years this has
led to some controversy. The new elements
with very high atomic numbers are so unstable
that only minute quantities, sometimes only

* Glenn T. Seaborg’s work in the middle of the 20th century starting with the discovery of plutonium in 1940, followed by
those of all the transuranium elements from 94 to 102 led to reconfiguration of the periodic table placing the actinoids below
the lanthanoids. In 1951, Seaborg was awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work. Element 106 has been named
Seaborgium (Sg) in his honour.

a few atoms of them are obtained. Their
synthesis and characterisation, therefore,
require highly sophisticated costly equipment
and laboratory. Such work is carried out with
competitive spirit only in some laboratories
in the world. Scientists, before collecting the
reliable data on the new element, at times
get tempted to claim for its discovery. For
example, both American and Soviet scientists
claimed credit for discovering element 104.
The Americans named it Rutherfordium
whereas Soviets named it Kurchatovium. To
avoid such problems, the IUPAC has made
recommendation that until a new element’s
discovery is proved, and its name is officially
recognised, a systematic nomenclature be
derived directly from the atomic number of
the element using the numerical roots for
0 and numbers 1-9. These are shown in
Table 3.4. The roots are put together in order of

digits which make up the atomic number and
“ium” is added at the end. The IUPAC names
for elements with Z above 100 are shown in
Table 3.5.

Thus, the new element first gets a
temporary name, with symbol consisting
of three letters. Later permanent name
and symbol are given by a vote of IUPAC
representatives from each country. The
permanent name might reflect the country
(or state of the country) in which the element
was discovered, or pay tribute to a notable
scientist. As of now, elements with atomic
numbers up to 118 have been discovered.
Official names of all elements have been
announced by IUPAC.
Problem 3.1
What would be the IUPAC name and
symbol for the element with atomic
number 120?
Solution
From Table 3.4, the roots for 1, 2 and 0
are un, bi and nil, respectively. Hence,
the symbol and the name respectively
are Ubn and unbinilium.
3.5

ELECTRONIC CONFIGURATIONS
OF ELEMENTS AND THE PERIODIC
TABLE

In the preceding unit we have learnt that an
electron in an atom is characterised by a set
of four quantum numbers, and the principal
quantum number (n ) defines the main energy
level known as shell. We have also studied
about the filling of electrons into different
subshells, also referred to as orbitals (s, p,
d, f ) in an atom. The distribution of electrons
into orbitals of an atom is called its electronic
configuration. An element’s location in the
Periodic Table reflects the quantum numbers
of the last orbital filled. In this section we
will observe a direct connection between the
electronic configurations of the elements and
the long form of the Periodic Table.
(a) Electronic Configurations in Periods
The period indicates the value of n for the
outermost or valence shell. In other words,
successive period in the Periodic Table is
associated with the filling of the next higher
principal energy level (n = 1, n = 2, etc.). It can

81

be readily seen that the number of elements
in each period is twice the number of atomic
orbitals available in the energy level that is
being filled. The first period (n = 1) starts with
the filling of the lowest level (1s) and therefore
has two elements — hydrogen (ls1) and helium
(ls2) when the first shell (K) is completed. The
second period (n = 2) starts with lithium and the
third electron enters the 2s orbital. The next
element, beryllium has four electrons and has
the electronic configuration 1s22s2. Starting
from the next element boron, the 2p orbitals
are filled with electrons when the L shell is
completed at neon (2s22p6). Thus there are
8 elements in the second period. The third
period (n = 3) begins at sodium, and the added
electron enters a 3s orbital. Successive filling
of 3s and 3p orbitals gives rise to the third
period of 8 elements from sodium to argon. The
fourth period (n = 4) starts at potassium, and
the added electrons fill up the 4s orbital. Now
you may note that before the 4p orbital is filled,
filling up of 3d orbitals becomes energetically
favourable and we come across the so called 3d
transition series of elements. This starts from
scandium (Z = 21) which has the electronic
configuration 3d1 4s2. The 3d orbitals are filled
at zinc (Z=30) with electronic configuration
3d104s2. The fourth period ends at krypton
with the filling up of the 4p orbitals. Altogether
we have 18 elements in this fourth period. The
fifth period (n = 5) beginning with rubidium
is similar to the fourth period and contains
the 4d transition series starting at yttrium
(Z = 39). This period ends at xenon with the
filling up of the 5p orbitals. The sixth period
(n = 6) contains 32 elements and successive
electrons enter 6s, 4f, 5d and 6p orbitals, in
the order — filling up of the 4f orbitals begins
with cerium (Z = 58) and ends at lutetium
(Z = 71) to give the 4f-inner transition series
which is called the lanthanoid series. The
seventh period (n = 7) is similar to the sixth
period with the successive filling up of the
7s, 5f, 6d and 7p orbitals and includes most
of the man-made radioactive elements. This
period will end at the element with atomic
number 118 which would belong to the noble
gas family. Filling up of the 5f orbitals after

chemistry

actinium (Z = 89) gives the 5f-inner transition
series known as the actinoid series. The 4fand 5f-inner transition series of elements
are placed separately in the Periodic Table
to maintain its structure and to preserve the
principle of classification by keeping elements
with similar properties in a single column.
Problem 3.2
How would you justify the presence
of 18 elements in the 5th period of the
Periodic Table?
Solution
When n = 5, l = 0, 1, 2, 3. The order
in which the energy of the available
orbitals 4d, 5s and 5p increases is 5s
< 4d < 5p. The total number of orbitals
available are 9. The maximum number
of electrons that can be accommodated
is 18; and therefore 18 elements are
there in the 5th period.
(b) Groupwise Electronic Configurations
Elements in the same vertical column or
group have similar valence shell electronic
configurations, the same number of electrons
in the outer orbitals, and similar properties.
For example, the Group 1 elements (alkali
metals) all have ns1 valence shell electronic
configuration as shown below.

Thus it can be seen that the properties of
an element have periodic dependence upon

a theoretical foundation for the periodic
classification. The elements in a vertical column
of the Periodic Table constitute a group or
family and exhibit similar chemical behaviour.
This similarity arises because these elements
have the same number and same distribution
of electrons in their outermost orbitals. We
can classify the elements into four blocks viz.,
s-block, p-block, d-block and f-block
depending on the type of atomic orbitals that
are being filled with electrons. This is illustrated
in Fig. 3.3. We notice two exceptions to this
categorisation. Strictly, helium belongs to the
s-block but its positioning in the p-block
along with other group 18 elements is
justified because it has a completely filled
valence shell (1s2) and as a result, exhibits
properties characteristic of other noble gases.
The other exception is hydrogen. It has only
one s-electron and hence can be placed in
group 1 (alkali metals). It can also
gain an electron to achieve a noble gas
arrangement and hence it can behave
similar to a group 17 (halogen family)
elements. Because it is a special case, we
shall place hydrogen separately at the top of
the Periodic Table as shown in Fig. 3.2 and
Fig. 3.3. We will briefly discuss the salient
features of the four types of elements marked in
the Periodic Table. More about these elements

reactive metals with low ionization enthalpies.
They lose the outermost electron(s) readily to
form 1+ ion (in the case of alkali metals) or 2+
ion (in the case of alkaline earth metals). The
metallic character and the reactivity increase
as we go down the group. Because of high
reactivity they are never found pure in nature.

valence (oxidation states), paramagnetism and
oftenly used as catalysts. However, Zn, Cd and
Hg which have the electronic configuration,
(n-1) d10ns2 do not show most of the properties
of transition elements. In a way, transition
metals form a bridge between the chemically
active metals of s-block elements and the
less active elements of Groups 13 and 14 and
thus take their familiar name “Transition
Elements”.

3.6.2 The p-Block Elements

3.6.4 The f-Block Elements
(Inner-Transition Elements)
The two rows of elements at the bottom of
the Periodic Table, called the Lanthanoids,
Ce(Z = 58) – Lu(Z = 71) and Actinoids,
Th(Z = 90) – Lr (Z = 103) are characterised by
the outer electronic configuration (n-2)f1-14
(n-1)d0–1ns2. The last electron added to each
element is filled in f- orbital. These two series
of elements are hence called the InnerTransition Elements (f-Block Elements).
They are all metals. Within each series, the
properties of the elements are quite similar.
The chemistry of the early actinoids is
more complicated than the corresponding
lanthanoids, due to the large number of
oxidation states possible for these actinoid
elements. Actinoid elements are radioactive.
Many of the actinoid elements have been made
only in nanogram quantities or even less by
nuclear reactions and their chemistry is not
fully studied. The elements after uranium are
called Transuranium Elements.

The p-Block Elements comprise those
belonging to Group 13 to 18 and these
together with the s-Block Elements are
called the Representative Elements or Main
Group Elements. The outermost electronic
configuration varies from ns2np1 to ns2np6
in each period. At the end of each period is
a noble gas element with a closed valence
shell ns2np6 configuration. All the orbitals
in the valence shell of the noble gases are
completely filled by electrons and it is very
difficult to alter this stable arrangement by
the addition or removal of electrons. The
noble gases thus exhibit very low chemical
reactivity. Preceding the noble gas family
are two chemically important groups of nonmetals. They are the halogens (Group 17) and
the chalcogens (Group 16). These two groups
of elements have highly negative electron
gain enthalpies and readily add one or two
electrons respectively to attain the stable
noble gas configuration. The non-metallic
character increases as we move from left to
right across a period and metallic character
increases as we go down the group.
3.6.3 The d-Block Elements (Transition
Elements)
These are the elements of Group 3 to 12 in
the centre of the Periodic Table. These are
characterised by the filling of inner d orbitals
by electrons and are therefore referred to as
d-Block Elements. These elements have
the general outer electronic configuration
(n-1)d1-10ns0-2 except for Pd where its electronic
configuration is 4d105s0.. They are all metals.
They mostly form coloured ions, exhibit variable

Problem 3.3

been discovered. In which family/group
would you place these elements and
also give the electronic configuration in
each case.

with Z = 117, would belong to the
halogen family (Group 17) and the
electronic configuration would be [Rn]
5f146d107s27p5. The element with Z = 120,
will be placed in Group 2 (alkaline earth
metals), and will have the electronic
configuration [Uuo]8s2.

Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties

3.6.5	Metals, Non-metals and Metalloids
In addition to displaying the classification
of elements into s-, p-, d-, and f-blocks,
Fig. 3.3 shows another broad classification
of elements based on their properties. The
elements can be divided into Metals and
Non-Metals. Metals comprise more than
78% of all known elements and appear on
the left side of the Periodic Table. Metals are
usually solids at room temperature [mercury
is an exception; gallium and caesium also
have very low melting points (303K and
302K, respectively)]. Metals usually have high
melting and boiling points. They are good
conductors of heat and electricity. They are
malleable (can be flattened into thin sheets by
hammering) and ductile (can be drawn into
wires). In contrast, non-metals are located at
the top right hand side of the Periodic Table.
In fact, in a horizontal row, the property of
elements change from metallic on the left to
non-metallic on the right. Non-metals are
usually solids or gases at room temperature
with low melting and boiling points (boron
and carbon are exceptions). They are poor
conductors of heat and electricity. Most nonmetallic solids are brittle and are neither
malleable nor ductile. The elements become
more metallic as we go down a group; the
non-metallic character increases as one goes
from left to right across the Periodic Table.
The change from metallic to non-metallic
character is not abrupt as shown by the thick
zig-zag line in Fig. 3.3. The elements (e.g.,
silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony and
tellurium) bordering this line and running
diagonally across the Periodic Table show
properties that are characteristic of both
metals and non-metals. These elements are
called Semi-metals or Metalloids.
Problem 3.4
Considering the atomic number and
position in the periodic table, arrange
the following elements in the increasing
order of metallic character : Si, Be, Mg,
Na, P.

85

Solution
Metallic character increases down a
group and decreases along a period as
we move from left to right. Hence the
order of increasing metallic character
is: P < Si < Be < Mg < Na.
3.7

PERIODIC TRENDS IN PROPERTIES
OF ELEMENTS

There are many observable patterns in the
physical and chemical properties of elements
as we descend in a group or move across a
period in the Periodic Table. For example,
within a period, chemical reactivity tends to
be high in Group 1 metals, lower in elements
towards the middle of the table, and increases
to a maximum in the Group 17 non-metals.
Likewise within a group of representative
metals (say alkali metals) reactivity increases
on moving down the group, whereas within a
group of non-metals (say halogens), reactivity
decreases down the group. But why do the
properties of elements follow these trends?
And how can we explain periodicity? To
answer these questions, we must look into the
theories of atomic structure and properties
of the atom. In this section we shall discuss
the periodic trends in certain physical and
chemical properties and try to explain them
in terms of number of electrons and energy
levels.
3.7.1	Trends in Physical Properties
There are numerous physical properties of
elements such as melting and boiling points,
heats of fusion and vaporization, energy
of atomization, etc. which show periodic
variations. However, we shall discuss the
periodic trends with respect to atomic and
ionic radii, ionization enthalpy, electron gain
enthalpy and electronegativity.
(a) Atomic Radius
You can very well imagine that finding the
size of an atom is a lot more complicated than
measuring the radius of a ball. Do you know
why? Firstly, because the size of an atom
(~ 1.2 Å i.e., 1.2 × 10–10 m in radius) is very



Unit 3.indd 85

9/9/2022 4:36:14 PM

86

chemistry

small. Secondly, since the electron cloud
surrounding the atom does not have a sharp
boundary, the determination of the atomic
size cannot be precise. In other words, there
is no practical way by which the size of an
individual atom can be measured. However,
an estimate of the atomic size can be made by
knowing the distance between the atoms in
the combined state. One practical approach to
estimate the size of an atom of a non-metallic
element is to measure the distance between
two atoms when they are bound together
by a single bond in a covalent molecule and
from this value, the “Covalent Radius” of the
element can be calculated. For example, the
bond distance in the chlorine molecule (Cl2)
is 198 pm and half this distance (99 pm), is
taken as the atomic radius of chlorine. For
metals, we define the term “Metallic Radius”
which is taken as half the internuclear
distance separating the metal cores in the
metallic crystal. For example, the distance
between two adjacent copper atoms in solid
copper is 256 pm; hence the metallic radius
of copper is assigned a value of 128 pm. For
simplicity, in this book, we use the term
Atomic Radius to refer to both covalent or
metallic radius depending on whether the
element is a non-metal or a metal. Atomic
radii can be measured by X-ray or other
spectroscopic methods.

The atomic radii of a few elements are listed
in Table 3.6. Two trends are obvious. We can
explain these trends in terms of nuclear charge
and energy level. The atomic size generally
decreases across a period as illustrated in
Fig. 3.4(a) for the elements of the second
period. It is because within the period the
outer electrons are in the same valence shell
and the effective nuclear charge increases
as the atomic number increases resulting in
the increased attraction of electrons to the
nucleus. Within a family or vertical column
of the periodic table, the atomic radius
increases regularly with atomic number as
illustrated in Fig. 3.4(b). For alkali metals
and halogens, as we descend the groups,
the principal quantum number (n) increases
and the valence electrons are farther from
the nucleus. This happens because the inner
energy levels are filled with electrons, which
serve to shield the outer electrons from the
pull of the nucleus. Consequently the size of
the atom increases as reflected in the atomic
radii.
Note that the atomic radii of noble gases
are not considered here. Being monoatomic,
their (non-bonded radii) values are very
large. In fact radii of noble gases should be
compared not with the covalent radii but with
the van der Waals radii of other elements.

number across the second period

(b) Ionic Radius

cation with the greater positive charge will
have a smaller radius because of the greater
attraction of the electrons to the nucleus.
Anion with the greater negative charge will
have the larger radius. In this case, the net
repulsion of the electrons will outweigh the
nuclear charge and the ion will expand in size.

The removal of an electron from an atom
results in the formation of a cation, whereas
gain of an electron leads to an anion. The
ionic radii can be estimated by measuring
the distances between cations and anions
in ionic crystals. In general, the ionic radii
of elements exhibit the same trend as the
atomic radii. A cation is smaller than its
parent atom because it has fewer electrons
while its nuclear charge remains the same.
The size of an anion will be larger than that of
the parent atom because the addition of one
or more electrons would result in increased
repulsion among the electrons and a decrease
in effective nuclear charge. For example, the
ionic radius of fluoride ion (F–) is 136 pm
whereas the atomic radius of fluorine is only
64 pm. On the other hand, the atomic radius
of sodium is 186 pm compared to the ionic
radius of 95 pm for Na+.
When we find some atoms and ions which
contain the same number of electrons, we call
them isoelectronic species*. For example,
O2–, F–, Na+ and Mg2+ have the same number
of electrons (10). Their radii would be different
because of their different nuclear charges. The

Problem 3.5
Which of the following species will have
the largest and the smallest size?
Mg, Mg2+, Al, Al3+.
Solution
Atomic radii decrease across a period.
Cations are smaller than their parent
atoms. Among isoelectronic species,
the one with the larger positive nuclear
charge will have a smaller radius.
Hence the largest species is Mg; the
smallest one is Al3+.
(c) Ionization Enthalpy
A quantitative measure of the tendency of
an element to lose electron is given by its
Ionization Enthalpy. It represents the
energy required to remove an electron from an
isolated gaseous atom (X) in its ground state.

* Two or more species with same number of atoms, same number of valence electrons and same structure, regardless of the
nature of elements involved.

chemistry

In other words, the first ionization enthalpy
for an element X is the enthalpy change
(∆i H) for the reaction depicted in equation 3.1.
X(g) → X+(g) + e–			
(3.1)
The ionization enthalpy is expressed in
units of kJ mol–1. We can define the second
ionization enthalpy as the energy required
to remove the second most loosely bound
electron; it is the energy required to carry out
the reaction shown in equation 3.2.
X+(g) → X2+(g) + e–			
(3.2)
Energy is always required to remove
electrons from an atom and hence ionization
enthalpies are always positive. The second
ionization enthalpy will be higher than the
first ionization enthalpy because it is more
difficult to remove an electron from a positively
charged ion than from a neutral atom. In the
same way the third ionization enthalpy will be
higher than the second and so on. The term
“ionization enthalpy”, if not qualified, is taken
as the first ionization enthalpy.
The first ionization enthalpies of elements
having atomic numbers up to 60 are plotted
in Fig. 3.5. The periodicity of the graph is
quite striking. You will find maxima at the
noble gases which have closed electron shells
and very stable electron configurations. On
the other hand, minima occur at the alkali
metals and their low ionization enthalpies

Fig. 3.5

Variation of first ionization enthalpies
(∆iH) with atomic number for elements
with Z = 1 to 60

can be correlated with their high reactivity.
In addition, you will notice two trends the
first ionization enthalpy generally increases
as we go across a period and decreases
as we descend in a group. These trends
are illustrated in Figs. 3.6(a) and 3.6(b)
respectively for the elements of the second
period and the first group of the periodic
table. You will appreciate that the ionization
enthalpy and atomic radius are closely related
properties. To understand these trends, we
have to consider two factors : (i) the attraction
of electrons towards the nucleus, and (ii) the
repulsion of electrons from each other. The
effective nuclear charge experienced by a

Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties

valence electron in an atom will be less than
the actual charge on the nucleus because of
“shielding” or “screening” of the valence
electron from the nucleus by the intervening
core electrons. For example, the 2s electron
in lithium is shielded from the nucleus by
the inner core of 1s electrons. As a result, the
valence electron experiences a net positive
charge which is less than the actual charge
of +3. In general, shielding is effective when
the orbitals in the inner shells are completely
filled. This situation occurs in the case of
alkali metals which have single outermost
ns-electron preceded by a noble gas electronic
configuration.
When we move from lithium to fluorine
across the second period, successive electrons
are added to orbitals in the same principal
quantum level and the shielding of the nuclear
charge by the inner core of electrons does
not increase very much to compensate for
the increased attraction of the electron to the
nucleus. Thus, across a period, increasing
nuclear charge outweighs the shielding.
Consequently, the outermost electrons are
held more and more tightly and the ionization
enthalpy increases across a period. As we go
down a group, the outermost electron being
increasingly farther from the nucleus, there is
an increased shielding of the nuclear charge
by the electrons in the inner levels. In this
case, increase in shielding outweighs the
increasing nuclear charge and the removal of
the outermost electron requires less energy
down a group.
From Fig. 3.6(a), you will also notice that
the first ionization enthalpy of boron (Z = 5)
is slightly less than that of beryllium (Z = 4)
even though the former has a greater nuclear
charge. When we consider the same principal
quantum level, an s-electron is attracted to the
nucleus more than a p-electron. In beryllium,
the electron removed during the ionization is
an s-electron whereas the electron removed
during ionization of boron is a p-electron. The
penetration of a 2s-electron to the nucleus is
more than that of a 2p-electron; hence the 2p
electron of boron is more shielded from the
nucleus by the inner core of electrons than

89

the 2s electrons of beryllium. Therefore, it is
easier to remove the 2p-electron from boron
compared to the removal of a 2s- electron from
beryllium. Thus, boron has a smaller first
ionization enthalpy than beryllium. Another
“anomaly” is the smaller first ionization
enthalpy of oxygen compared to nitrogen. This
arises because in the nitrogen atom, three
2p-electrons reside in different atomic orbitals
(Hund’s rule) whereas in the oxygen atom,
two of the four 2p-electrons must occupy the
same 2p-orbital resulting in an increased
electron-electron repulsion. Consequently,
it is easier to remove the fourth 2p-electron
from oxygen than it is, to remove one of the
three 2p-electrons from nitrogen.
Problem 3.6
The first ionization enthalpy (∆i H ) values
of the third period elements, Na, Mg and
Si are respectively 496, 737 and 786 kJ
mol–1. Predict whether the first ∆i H value
for Al will be more close to 575 or 760 kJ
mol–1 ? Justify your answer.
Solution
It will be more close to 575 kJ mol–1.
The value for Al should be lower than
that of Mg because of effective shielding
of 3p electrons from the nucleus by
3s-electrons.
(d) Electron Gain Enthalpy
When an electron is added to a neutral
gaseous atom (X) to convert it into a negative
ion, the enthalpy change accompanying the
process is defined as the Electron Gain
Enthalpy (∆ egH). Electron gain enthalpy
provides a measure of the ease with which
an atom adds an electron to form anion as
represented by equation 3.3.
X(g) + e – → X –(g)			

(3.3)

Depending on the element, the process
of adding an electron to the atom can be
either endothermic or exothermic. For many
elements energy is released when an electron
is added to the atom and the electron gain
enthalpy is negative. For example, group
17 elements (the halogens) have very high

negative electron gain enthalpies because
they can attain stable noble gas electronic
configurations by picking up an electron.
On the other hand, noble gases have large
positive electron gain enthalpies because the
electron has to enter the next higher principal
quantum level leading to a very unstable
electronic configuration. It may be noted that
electron gain enthalpies have large negative
values toward the upper right of the periodic
table preceding the noble gases.
The variation in electron gain enthalpies of
elements is less systematic than for ionization
enthalpies. As a general rule, electron gain
enthalpy becomes more negative with increase
in the atomic number across a period. The
effective nuclear charge increases from left to
right across a period and consequently it will
be easier to add an electron to a smaller atom
since the added electron on an average would
be closer to the positively charged nucleus. We
should also expect electron gain enthalpy to
become less negative as we go down a group
because the size of the atom increases and
the added electron would be farther from the
nucleus. This is generally the case (Table
3.7). However, electron gain enthalpy of O or
F is less negative than that of the succeeding
element. This is because when an electron is
added to O or F, the added electron goes to
the smaller n = 2 quantum level and suffers
significant repulsion from the other electrons
present in this level. For the n = 3 quantum
level (S or Cl), the added electron occupies
a larger region of space and the electronelectron repulsion is much less.

Problem 3.7
Which of the following will have the most
negative electron gain enthalpy and
which the least negative?
P, S, Cl, F.
Explain your answer.
Solution
Electron gain enthalpy generally
becomes more negative across a
period as we move from left to right.
Within a group, electron gain enthalpy
becomes less negative down a group.
However, adding an electron to the
2p-orbital leads to greater repulsion
than adding an electron to the larger
3p-orbital. Hence the element with
most negative electron gain enthalpy is
chlorine; the one with the least negative
electron gain enthalpy is phosphorus.
(e) Electronegativity
A qualitative measure of the ability of an atom
in a chemical compound to attract shared
electrons to itself is called electronegativity.
Unlike ionization enthalpy and electron gain
enthalpy, it is not a measureable quantity.
However, a number of numerical scales of
electronegativity of elements viz., Pauling
scale, Mulliken-Jaffe scale, Allred-Rochow
scale have been developed. The one which
is the most widely used is the Pauling scale.
Linus Pauling, an American scientist, in 1922
assigned arbitrarily a value of 4.0 to fluorine,
the element considered to have the greatest

* In many books, the negative of the enthalpy change for the process depicted in equation 3.3 is defined as the ELECTRON

AFFINITY (Ae ) of the atom under consideration. If energy is released when an electron is added to an atom, the electron
affinity is taken as positive, contrary to thermodynamic convention. If energy has to be supplied to add an electron to an
atom, then the electron affinity of the atom is assigned a negative sign. However, electron affinity is defined as absolute
zero and, therefore at any other temperature (T) heat capacities of the reactants and the products have to be taken into
account in ∆egH = –Ae – 5/2 RT.

ability to attract electrons. Approximate
values for the electronegativity of a few
elements are given in Table 3.8(a)
The electronegativity of any given element
is not constant; it varies depending on the
element to which it is bound. Though it is
not a measurable quantity, it does provide a
means of predicting the nature of force that
holds a pair of atoms together – a relationship
that you will explore later.
Electronegativity generally
increases across a period from
left to right (say from lithium to
fluorine) and decrease down a group
(say from fluorine to astatine)
in the periodic table. How can
these trends be explained?
Can the electronegativity be
related to atomic radii, which
tend to decrease across each
period from left to right, but
increase down each group ? The
attraction between the outer
(or valence) electrons and the
nucleus increases as the atomic
radius decreases in a period. The
electronegativity also increases.

91

On the same account electronegativity values
decrease with the increase in atomic radii
down a group. The trend is similar to that of
ionization enthalpy.
Knowing the relationship between
electronegativity and atomic radius, can
you now visualise the relationship between
electronegativity and non-metallic properties?
Non-metallic elements have strong tendency

to gain electrons. Therefore, electronegativity is
directly related to that non-metallic properties
of elements. It can be further extended to say
that the electronegativity is inversely related
to the metallic properties of elements. Thus,
the increase in electronegativities across
a period is accompanied by an increase
in non-metallic properties (or decrease in
metallic properties) of elements. Similarly, the
decrease in electronegativity down a group is
accompanied by a decrease in non-metallic
properties (or increase in metallic properties)
of elements.
All these periodic trends are summarised
in Figure 3.7.
3.7.2 Periodic Trends in Chemical 		
Properties
Most of the trends in chemical properties of
elements, such as diagonal relationships, inert
pair effect, effects of lanthanoid contraction
etc. will be dealt with along the discussion
of each group in later units. In this section
we shall study the periodicity of the valence
state shown by elements and the anomalous
properties of the second period elements (from
lithium to fluorine).
(a) Periodicity of Valence or Oxidation
States
The valence is the most characteristic property
of the elements and can be understood in
terms of their electronic configurations.  The
valence of representative elements is usually
(though not necessarily) equal to the number
of electrons in the outermost orbitals and/or
equal to eight minus the number of outermost
electrons as shown below.
Nowadays the term oxidation state is
frequently used for valence. Consider the
two oxygen containing compounds: OF2 and
Na2O. The order of electronegativity of the
three elements involved in these compounds
is F > O > Na. Each of the atoms of fluorine,

with outer electronic configuration 2s22p5,
shares one electron with oxygen in the OF2
molecule. Being highest electronegative
element, fluorine is given oxidation state
–1. Since there are two fluorine atoms in
this molecule, oxygen with outer electronic
configuration 2s22p4 shares two electrons
with fluorine atoms and thereby exhibits
oxidation state +2. In Na2O, oxygen being
more electronegative accepts two electrons,
one from each of the two sodium atoms and,
thus, shows oxidation state –2. On the other
hand sodium with electronic configuration
3s1 loses one electron to oxygen and is given
oxidation state +1. Thus, the oxidation state
of an element in a particular compound can
be defined as the charge acquired by its atom
on the basis of electronegative consideration
from other atoms in the molecule.
Problem 3.8
Using the Periodic Table, predict the
formulas of compounds which might
be formed by the following pairs of
elements; (a) silicon and bromine
(b) aluminium and sulphur.
Solution
(a) Silicon is group 14 element with
a valence of 4; bromine belongs to
the halogen family with a valence
of 1. Hence the formula of the
compound formed would be SiBr4.
(b) Aluminium belongs to group
13 with a valence of 3; sulphur
belongs to group 16 elements with
a valence of 2. Hence, the formula
of the compound formed would be
Al2S3.
Some periodic trends observed in the
valence of elements (hydrides and oxides)
are shown in Table 3.9. Other such periodic
trends which occur in the chemical behaviour
of the elements are discussed elsewhere in

What are the reasons for the different
chemical behaviour of the first member of
a group of elements in the s- and p-blocks
compared to that of the subsequent members
in the same group? The anomalous behaviour
is attributed to their small size, large charge/
radius ratio and high electronegativity of the
elements.   In addition, the first member of
group has only four valence orbitals (2s and
2p) available for bonding, whereas the second
member of the groups have nine valence
orbitals (3s, 3p, 3d). As a consequence of
this, the maximum covalency of the first
member of each group is 4 (e.g., boron

The first element of each of the groups 1

from the other members of their respective

alkali metals, and beryllium unlike other
alkaline earth metals, form compounds with
pronounced covalent character; the other
members of these groups predominantly
form ionic compounds. In fact the behaviour

member of p-block elements displays
greater ability to form pπ – pπ multiple

3.7.3 Periodic Trends
	Reactivity

and

Chemical

We have observed the periodic trends in
certain fundamental properties such as
atomic and ionic radii, ionization enthalpy,
electron gain enthalpy and valence. We
know by now that the periodicity is related to
electronic configuration. That is, all chemical
and physical properties are a manifestation of
the electronic configuration of elements. We
shall now try to explore relationships between
these fundamental properties of elements with
their chemical reactivity.
The atomic and ionic radii, as we know,
generally decrease in a period from left to right.
As a consequence, the ionization enthalpies
generally increase (with some exceptions as
outlined in section 3.7.1(a)) and electron gain
enthalpies become more negative across a
period. In other words, the ionization enthalpy
of the extreme left element in a period is the
least and the electron gain enthalpy of the
element on the extreme right is the highest
negative (note : noble gases having completely
filled shells have rather positive electron
gain enthalpy values). This results into high
chemical reactivity at the two extremes and
the lowest in the centre. Thus, the maximum
chemical reactivity at the extreme left (among
alkali metals) is exhibited by the loss of an
electron leading to the formation of a cation
and at the extreme right (among halogens)
shown by the gain of an electron forming
an anion. This property can be related with
the reducing and oxidizing behaviour of the
elements which you will learn later. However,

here it can be directly related to the metallic
and non-metallic character of elements. Thus,
the metallic character of an element, which
is highest at the extremely left decreases and
the non-metallic character increases while
moving from left to right across the period.
The chemical reactivity of an element can be
best shown by its reactions with oxygen and
halogens. Here, we shall consider the reaction
of the elements with oxygen only. Elements
on two extremes of a period easily combine
with oxygen to form oxides. The normal oxide
formed by the element on extreme left is the
most basic (e.g., Na2O), whereas that formed
by the element on extreme right is the most
acidic (e.g., Cl2O7). Oxides of elements in the
centre are amphoteric (e.g., Al2O3, As2O3) or
neutral (e.g., CO, NO, N2O). Amphoteric oxides
behave as acidic with bases and as basic with
acids, whereas neutral oxides have no acidic
or basic properties.
Problem 3.10
Show by a chemical reaction with water
that Na2O is a basic oxide and Cl2O7 is
an acidic oxide.
Solution
Na2O with water forms a strong base
whereas Cl2O7 forms strong acid.
Na2O + H2O → 2NaOH
Cl2O7 + H2O → 2HClO4
Their basic or acidic nature can be
qualitatively tested with litmus paper.
Among transition metals (3d series), the
change in atomic radii is much smaller as
compared to those of representative elements
across the period. The change in atomic radii
is still smaller among inner-transition metals
(4f series). The ionization enthalpies are
intermediate between those of s- and p-blocks.
As a consequence, they are less electropositive
than group 1 and 2 metals.

Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties

In a group, the increase in atomic and
ionic radii with increase in atomic number
generally results in a gradual decrease in
ionization enthalpies and a regular decrease
(with exception in some third period elements
as shown in section 3.7.1(d)) in electron
gain enthalpies in the case of main group
elements. Thus, the metallic character

95

increases down the group and non-metallic
character decreases. This trend can be related
with their reducing and oxidizing property
which you will learn later. In the case of
transition elements, however, a reverse trend
is observed. This can be explained in terms of
atomic size and ionization enthalpy.

SUMMARY
In this Unit, you have studied the development of the Periodic Law and the Periodic Table.
Mendeleev’s Periodic Table was based on atomic masses. Modern Periodic Table arranges
the elements in the order of their atomic numbers in seven horizontal rows (periods) and
eighteen vertical columns (groups or families). Atomic numbers in a period are consecutive,
whereas in a group they increase in a pattern. Elements of the same group have similar
valence shell electronic configuration and, therefore, exhibit similar chemical properties.
However, the elements of the same period have incrementally increasing number of electrons
from left to right, and, therefore, have different valencies. Four types of elements can be
recognized in the periodic table on the basis of their electronic configurations. These are
s-block, p-block, d-block and f-block elements. Hydrogen with one electron in the 1s orbital
occupies a unique position in the periodic table. Metals comprise more than seventy eight
per cent of the known elements. Non-metals, which are located at the top of the periodic
table, are less than twenty in number. Elements which lie at the border line between metals
and non-metals (e.g., Si, Ge, As) are called metalloids or semi-metals. Metallic character
increases with increasing atomic number in a group whereas decreases from left to right
in a period. The physical and chemical properties of elements vary periodically with their
atomic numbers.
Periodic trends are observed in atomic sizes, ionization enthalpies, electron gain
enthalpies, electronegativity and valence. The atomic radii decrease while going from
left to right in a period and increase with atomic number in a group. Ionization enthalpies
generally increase across a period and decrease down a group. Electronegativity also shows
a similar trend. Electron gain enthalpies, in general, become more negative across a period
and less negative down a group. There is some periodicity in valence, for example, among
representative elements, the valence is either equal to the number of electrons in the
outermost orbitals or eight minus this number. Chemical reactivity is highest at the two
extremes of a period and is lowest in the centre. The reactivity on the left extreme of a period
is because of the ease of electron loss (or low ionization enthalpy). Highly reactive elements
do not occur in nature in free state; they usually occur in the combined form. Oxides formed
of the elements on the left are basic and of the elements on the right are acidic in nature.
Oxides of elements in the centre are amphoteric or neutral.

Scientists are constantly discovering new compounds,
orderly arranging the facts about them, trying to explain
with the existing knowledge, organising to modify the
earlier views or evolve theories for explaining the newly
observed facts.

Matter is made up of one or different type of elements.
Under normal conditions no other element exists as an
independent atom in nature, except noble gases. However,
a group of atoms is found to exist together as one species
having characteristic properties. Such a group of atoms
is called a molecule. Obviously there must be some force
which holds these constituent atoms together in the
molecules. The attractive force which holds various
constituents (atoms, ions, etc.) together in different
chemical species is called a chemical bond. Since the
formation of chemical compounds takes place as a result of
combination of atoms of various elements in different ways,
it raises many questions. Why do atoms combine? Why are
only certain combinations possible? Why do some atoms
combine while certain others do not? Why do molecules
possess definite shapes? To answer such questions different
theories and concepts have been put forward from time
to time. These are Kössel-Lewis approach, Valence Shell
Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory, Valence Bond (VB)
Theory and Molecular Orbital (MO) Theory. The evolution
of various theories of valence and the interpretation of
the nature of chemical bonds have closely been related to
the developments in the understanding of the structure
of atom, the electronic configuration of elements and the
periodic table. Every system tends to be more stable and
bonding is nature’s way of lowering the energy of the system
to attain stability.

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

4.1

KÖ ssel - L e w i s A p p roach t o
Chemical Bonding

In order to explain the formation of chemical
bond in terms of electrons, a number of
attempts were made, but it was only in
1916 when Kössel and Lewis succeeded
independently in giving a satisfactory
explanation. They were the first to provide
some logical explanation of valence which was
based on the inertness of noble gases.
Lewis pictured the atom in terms of a
positively charged ‘Kernel’ (the nucleus plus
the inner electrons) and the outer shell that
could accommodate a maximum of eight
electrons. He, further assumed that these
eight electrons occupy the corners of a cube
which surround the ‘Kernel’. Thus the single
outer shell electron of sodium would occupy
one corner of the cube, while in the case of
a noble gas all the eight corners would be
occupied. This octet of electrons, represents
a particularly stable electronic arrangement.
Lewis postulated that atoms achieve
the stable octet when they are linked by
chemical bonds. In the case of sodium and
chlorine, this can happen by the transfer of
an electron from sodium to chlorine thereby
giving the Na+ and Cl– ions. In the case of
other molecules like Cl2, H2, F2, etc., the bond
is formed by the sharing of a pair of electrons
between the atoms. In the process each atom
attains a stable outer octet of electrons.
Lewis Symbols: In the formation of a
molecule, only the outer shell electrons take
part in chemical combination and they are
known as valence electrons. The inner shell
electrons are well protected and are generally
not involved in the combination process.
G.N. Lewis, an American chemist introduced
simple notations to represent valence electrons
in an atom. These notations are called Lewis
symbols. For example, the Lewis symbols for
the elements of second period are as under:

Significance of Lewis Symbols : The
number of dots around the symbol represents

the number of valence electrons. This number
of valence electrons helps to calculate the
common or group valence of the element.
The group valence of the elements is generally
either equal to the number of dots in Lewis
symbols or 8 minus the number of dots or
valence electrons.
Kössel, in relation to chemical bonding,
drew attention to the following facts:
• In the periodic table, the highly
electronegative halogens and the highly
electropositive alkali metals are separated
by the noble gases;
• The formation of a negative ion from a
halogen atom and a positive ion from
an alkali metal atom is associated with
the gain and loss of an electron by the
respective atoms;
• The negative and positive ions thus
formed attain stable noble gas electronic
configurations. The noble gases (with the
exception of helium which has a duplet
of electrons) have a particularly stable
outer shell configuration of eight (octet)
electrons, ns2np6.
• The negative and positive ions are stabilized
by electrostatic attraction.
For example, the formation of NaCl from
sodium and chlorine, according to the above
scheme, can be explained as:
Na                →       Na+ + e–
[Ne] 3s1                   [Ne]
→
Cl–
Cl + e–

5
[Ne] 3s 3p              [Ne] 3s2 3p6 or [Ar]
Na+ + Cl– →        NaCl or Na+Cl–
Similarly the formation of CaF2 may be
shown as:
Ca
→
Ca2+ + 2e–
[Ar]4s2                    [Ar]
→
F–
F + e–
[He] 2s2 2p5             [He] 2s2 2p6  or [Ne]
→
CaF2 or Ca2+(F– )2
Ca2+ + 2F–
The bond formed, as a result of the
electrostatic attraction between the
positive and negative ions was termed as

chemistry

the electrovalent bond. The electrovalence
is thus equal to the number of unit charge(s)
on the ion. Thus, calcium is assigned a
positive electrovalence of two, while chlorine
a negative electrovalence of one.
Kössel’s postulations provide the basis for
the modern concepts regarding ion-formation
by electron transfer and the formation of ionic
crystalline compounds. His views have proved
to be of great value in the understanding and
systematisation of the ionic compounds. At
the same time he did recognise the fact that
a large number of compounds did not fit into
these concepts.
4.1.1 Octet Rule
Kössel and Lewis in 1916 developed an
important theory of chemical combination
between atoms known as electronic theory
of chemical bonding. According to this,
atoms can combine either by transfer of
valence electrons from one atom to another
(gaining or losing) or by sharing of valence
electrons in order to have an octet in their
valence shells. This is known as octet rule.
4.1.2 Covalent Bond
Langmuir (1919) refined the Lewis
postulations by abandoning the idea of
the stationary cubical arrangement of the
octet, and by introducing the term covalent
bond. The Lewis-Langmuir theory can be
understood by considering the formation of
the chlorine molecule, Cl2. The Cl atom with
electronic configuration, [Ne]3s2 3p5, is one
electron short of the argon configuration.
The formation of the Cl­2 molecule can be
understood in terms of the sharing of a pair
of electrons between the two chlorine atoms,
each chlorine atom contributing one electron
to the shared pair. In the process both

chlorine atoms attain the outer shell octet of
the nearest noble gas (i.e., argon).
The dots represent electrons. Such
structures are referred to as Lewis dot
structures.
The Lewis dot structures can be written for
other molecules also, in which the combining
atoms may be identical or different. The
important conditions being that:
• Each bond is formed as a result of sharing
of an electron pair between the atoms.
• Each combining atom contributes at least
one electron to the shared pair.
• The combining atoms attain the outershell noble gas configurations as a result
of the sharing of electrons.
• Thus in water and carbon tetrachloride
molecules, formation of covalent bonds
can be represented as:

Thus, when two atoms share one
electron pair they are said to be joined by
a single covalent bond. In many compounds
we have multiple bonds between atoms. The
formation of multiple bonds envisages sharing
of more than one electron pair between two
atoms. If two atoms share two pairs of
electrons, the covalent bond between them
is called a double bond. For example, in the
carbon dioxide molecule, we have two double
bonds between the carbon and oxygen atoms.
Similarly in ethene molecule the two carbon
atoms are joined by a double bond.

4.1.3 Lewis Representation of Simple
Molecules (the Lewis Structures)
The Lewis dot structures provide a picture
of bonding in molecules and ions in terms of
the shared pairs of electrons and the octet
rule. While such a picture may not explain
the bonding and behaviour of a molecule
completely, it does help in understanding the
formation and properties of a molecule to a
large extent. Writing of Lewis dot structures of
molecules is, therefore, very useful. The Lewis
dot structures can be written by adopting the
following steps:
• The total number of electrons required
for writing the structures are obtained
by adding the valence electrons of the
combining atoms. For example, in the CH4
molecule there are eight valence electrons
available for bonding (4 from carbon and
4 from the four hydrogen atoms).
• For anions, each negative charge would
mean addition of one electron. For cations,
each positive charge would result in
subtraction of one electron from the total

number of valence electrons. For example,
for the CO32– ion, the two negative charges
indicate that there are two additional
electrons than those provided by the
neutral atoms. For NH +4 ion, one positive
charge indicates the loss of one electron
from the group of neutral atoms.
Knowing the chemical symbols of the
combining atoms and having knowledge
of the skeletal structure of the compound
(known or guessed intelligently), it is easy
to distribute the total number of electrons
as bonding shared pairs between the
atoms in proportion to the total bonds.
In general the least electronegative atom
occupies the central position in the
molecule/ion. For example in the NF3 and
CO32–, nitrogen and carbon are the central
atoms whereas fluorine and oxygen
occupy the terminal positions.
After accounting for the shared pairs of
electrons for single bonds, the remaining
electron pairs are either utilized for
multiple bonding or remain as the lone
pairs. The basic requirement being
that each bonded atom gets an octet of
electrons.
Lewis representations of a few molecules/
ions are given in Table 4.1.

Problem 4.1
Write the Lewis dot structure of CO
molecule.
Solution
Step 1. Count the total number of valence
electrons of carbon and oxygen atoms.
The outer (valence) shell configurations
of carbon and oxygen atoms are: 2s2 2p2
and 2s2 2p4, respectively. The valence
electrons available are 4 + 6 =10.
Step 2. The skeletal structure of CO is
written as: C O

each of the oxygen atoms completing the
octets on oxygen atoms. This, however,
does not complete the octet on nitrogen
if the remaining two electrons constitute
lone pair on it.

Hence we have to resort to multiple
bonding between nitrogen and one of
the oxygen atoms (in this case a double
bond). This leads to the following Lewis
dot structures.

Step 3. Draw a single bond (one shared
electron pair) between C and O and
complete the octet on O, the remaining
two electrons are the lone pair on C.

This does not complete the octet on
carbon and hence we have to resort to
multiple bonding (in this case a triple
bond) between C and O atoms. This
satisfies the octet rule condition for both
atoms.

Problem 4.2
Write the Lewis structure of the nitrite
ion, NO2– .
Solution
Step 1. Count the total number of
valence electrons of the nitrogen atom,
the oxygen atoms and the additional one
negative charge (equal to one electron).
N(2s2 2p3), O (2s2 2p4)
5 + (2 × 6) +1 = 18 electrons
Step 2. The skeletal structure of NO2– is
written as :  O   N   O

4.1.4 Formal Charge
Lewis dot structures, in general, do not
represent the actual shapes of the molecules.
In case of polyatomic ions, the net charge is
possessed by the ion as a whole and not by
a particular atom. It is, however, feasible to
assign a formal charge on each atom. The
formal charge of an atom in a polyatomic
molecule or ion may be defined as the
difference between the number of valence
electrons of that atom in an isolated or free
state and the number of electrons assigned
to that atom in the Lewis structure. It is
expressed as :

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

The counting is based on the assumption
that the atom in the molecule owns one
electron of each shared pair and both the
electrons of a lone pair.
Let us consider the ozone molecule (O3).
The Lewis structure of O3 may be drawn as:

The atoms have been numbered as 1, 2

4.1.5 Limitations of the Octet Rule
The octet rule, though useful, is not universal.
It is quite useful for understanding the
structures of most of the organic compounds
and it applies mainly to the second period
elements of the periodic table. There are three
types of exceptions to the octet rule.
The incomplete octet of the central atom
In some compounds, the number of electrons
surrounding the central atom is less than
eight. This is especially the case with elements
having less than four valence electrons.
Examples are LiCl, BeH2 and BCl3.

and 3. The formal charge on:

•

The central O atom marked 1
=6–2–

•

(6) = +1

The end O atom marked 2

Li, Be and B have 1, 2 and 3 valence electrons
only. Some other such compounds are AlCl3
and BF3.

•

1
(4) = 0

The end O atom marked 3

Odd-electron molecules
In molecules with an odd number of electrons
like nitric oxide, NO and nitrogen dioxide,
NO2, the octet rule is not satisfied for all the
atoms

=6–4–

1
(2) = –1
2
Hence, we represent O3 along with the
formal charges as follows:
=6–6–

We must understand that formal charges
do not indicate real charge separation within
the molecule. Indicating the charges on the
atoms in the Lewis structure only helps in
keeping track of the valence electrons in
the molecule. Formal charges help in the
selection of the lowest energy structure from
a number of possible Lewis structures for a
given species. Generally the lowest energy
structure is the one with the smallest
formal charges on the atoms. The formal
charge is a factor based on a pure covalent
view of bonding in which electron pairs
are shared equally by neighbouring atoms.

The expanded octet
Elements in and beyond the third period of
the periodic table have, apart from 3s and 3p
orbitals, 3d orbitals also available for bonding.
In a number of compounds of these elements
there are more than eight valence electrons
around the central atom. This is termed as
the expanded octet. Obviously the octet rule
does not apply in such cases.
Some of the examples of such compounds
are: PF 5 , SF 6 , H 2 SO 4 and a number of
coordination compounds.

chemistry

Interestingly, sulphur also forms many
compounds in which the octet rule is obeyed.
In sulphur dichloride, the S atom has an octet
of electrons around it.

Other drawbacks of the octet theory
• It is clear that octet rule is based upon
the chemical inertness of noble gases.
However, some noble gases (for example
xenon and krypton) also combine with
oxygen and fluorine to form a number of
compounds like XeF2, KrF2, XeOF2 etc.
• This theory does not account for the shape
of molecules.
• It does not explain the relative stability of
the molecules being totally silent about
the energy of a molecule.
4.2	Ionic or Electrovalent Bond
From the Kössel and Lewis treatment of the
formation of an ionic bond, it follows that the
formation of ionic compounds would primarily
depend upon:
• The ease of formation of the positive and
negative ions from the respective neutral
atoms;
• The arrangement of the positive and
negative ions in the solid, that is, the
lattice of the crystalline compound.
The formation of a positive ion involves
ionization, i.e., removal of electron(s) from
the neutral atom and that of the negative
ion involves the addition of electron(s) to the
neutral atom.
M(g)        →
M+(g) + e– ;
                           Ionization enthalpy
→
X – (g) ;
X(g) + e–
                         Electron gain enthalpy
M+(g)  + X –(g)  →    MX(s)
The electron gain enthalpy, ∆eg H, is the
enthalpy change (Unit 3), when a gas phase
atom in its ground state gains an electron.
The electron gain process may be exothermic
or endothermic. The ionization, on the other
hand, is always endothermic. Electron

affinity, is the negative of the energy change
accompanying electron gain.
Obviously ionic bonds will be formed
more easily between elements with
comparatively low ionization enthalpies
and elements with comparatively high
negative value of electron gain enthalpy.
Most ionic compounds have cations
derived from metallic elements and anions
from non-metallic elements. The ammonium
ion, NH 4+ (made up of two non-metallic
elements) is an exception. It forms the cation
of a number of ionic compounds.
Ionic compounds in the crystalline
state consist of orderly three-dimensional
arrangements of cations and anions held
together by coulombic interaction energies.
These compounds crystallise in different
crystal structures determined by the size of
the ions, their packing arrangements and
other factors. The crystal structure of sodium
chloride, NaCl (rock salt), for example is
shown below.

Rock salt structure

In ionic solids, the sum of the electron gain
enthalpy and the ionization enthalpy may be
positive but still the crystal structure gets
stabilized due to the energy released in the
formation of the crystal lattice. For example:
the ionization enthalpy for Na+(g) formation
from Na(g) is 495.8 kJ mol–1 ; while the electron
gain enthalpy for the change Cl(g) + e–→
Cl– (g) is, – 348.7 kJ mol–1 only. The sum of the
two, 147.1 kJ mol-1 is more than compensated
for by the enthalpy of lattice formation of
NaCl(s) (–788 kJ mol–1). Therefore, the energy
released in the processes is more than the



Unit 4.indd 106

107

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

energy absorbed. Thus a qualitative measure
of the stability of an ionic compound
is provided by its enthalpy of lattice
formation and not simply by achieving
octet of electrons around the ionic species
in gaseous state.
Since lattice enthalpy plays a key role
in the formation of ionic compounds, it is
important that we learn more about it.
4.2.1 Lattice Enthalpy
The Lattice Enthalpy of an ionic solid
is defined as the energy required to
completely separate one mole of a solid
ionic compound into gaseous constituent
ions. For example, the lattice enthalpy of
NaCl is 788 kJ mol–1. This means that 788
kJ of energy is required to separate one mole
of solid NaCl into one mole of Na+ (g) and one
mole of Cl– (g) to an infinite distance.
This process involves both the attractive
forces between ions of opposite charges
and the repulsive forces between ions of
like charge. The solid crystal being threedimensional; it is not possible to calculate
lattice enthalpy directly from the interaction
of forces of attraction and repulsion only.
Factors associated with the crystal geometry
have to be included.

respectively)

in the same molecule. The van der Waals
radius represents the overall size of the
atom which includes its valence shell in a
nonbonded situation. Further, the van der
Waals radius is half of the distance between
two similar atoms in separate molecules in
a solid. Covalent and van der Waals radii of

4.3.1 Bond Length
Bond length is defined as the equilibrium
distance between the nuclei of two bonded
atoms in a molecule. Bond lengths are
measured by spectroscopic, X-ray diffraction
and electron-diffraction techniques about
which you will learn in higher classes. Each
atom of the bonded pair contributes to the
bond length (Fig. 4.1). In the case of a covalent
bond, the contribution from each atom is
called the covalent radius of that atom.

chemistry

Some typical average bond lengths for
single, double and triple bonds are shown in
Table 4.2. Bond lengths for some common
molecules are given in Table 4.3.
The covalent radii of some common
elements are listed in Table 4.4.
4.3.2 Bond Angle
It is defined as the angle between the orbitals
containing bonding electron pairs around the
central atom in a molecule/complex ion. Bond
angle is expressed in degree which can be
experimentally determined by spectroscopic
methods. It gives some idea regarding the
distribution of orbitals around the central
atom in a molecule/complex ion and hence it
helps us in determining its shape. For
example H–O–H bond angle in water can be
represented as under :

4.3.3 Bond Enthalpy
It is defined as the amount of energy required
to break one mole of bonds of a particular
type between two atoms in a gaseous state.
The unit of bond enthalpy is kJ mol–1. For
example, the H – H bond enthalpy in hydrogen
molecule is 435.8 kJ mol–1.
H2(g) → H(g) + H(g); ∆aH = 435.8 kJ mol–1
Similarly the bond enthalpy for molecules
containing multiple bonds, for example O2 and
N2 will be as under :
O2 (O = O) (g) → O(g) + O(g);
∆aH = 498 kJ mol–1
N2 (N ≡ N) (g) → N(g) + N(g);
∆aH = 946.0 kJ mol–1
It is important that larger the bond
dissociation enthalpy, stronger will be the
bond in the molecule. For a heteronuclear
diatomic molecules like HCl, we have
HCl (g) → H(g) + Cl (g); ∆aH = 431.0 kJ mol–1
In case of polyatomic molecules, the
measurement of bond strength is more
complicated. For example in case  o f H 2O
molecule, the enthalpy needed to break the
two O – H bonds is not the same.

H2O(g)  →  H(g) + OH(g); ∆aH1 =  502 kJ mol–1
OH(g)  →  H(g) + O(g); ∆aH2 = 427 kJ mol–1
The difference in the ∆aH value shows
that the second O – H bond undergoes
some change because of changed chemical
environment. This is the reason for some
difference in energy of the same O – H bond
in different molecules like C2H5OH (ethanol)
and water. Therefore in polyatomic molecules
the term mean or average bond enthalpy
is used. It is obtained by dividing total bond
dissociation enthalpy by the number of bonds
broken as explained below in case of water
molecule,
502 + 427
Average bond enthalpy =
2
                                = 464.5 kJ mol–1
4.3.4 Bond Order
In the Lewis description of covalent bond,
the Bond Order is given by the number
of bonds between the two atoms in a
molecule. The bond order, for example in
H2 (with a single shared electron pair), in O2
(with two shared electron pairs) and in N2
(with three shared electron pairs) is 1,2,3
respectively. Similarly in CO (three shared
electron pairs between C and O) the bond
order is 3. For N2, bond order is 3 and its
is 946 kJ mol–1; being one of the highest
for a diatomic molecule.
Isoelectronic molecules and ions have
identical bond orders; for example, F2 and
O22– have bond order 1. N2, CO and NO+ have
bond order 3.
A general correlation useful for
understanding the stablities of molecules
is that: with increase in bond order,
bond enthalpy increases and bond length
decreases.
4.3.5 Resonance Structures
It is often observed that a single Lewis structure
is inadequate for the representation of a
molecule in conformity with its experimentally
determined parameters. For example, the
ozone, O3 molecule can be equally represented
by the structures I and II shown below:

Fig. 4.3

Resonance in the O3 molecule

(structures I and II represent the two canonical
forms while the structure III is the resonance hybrid)

In both structures we have a O–O single
bond and a O=O double bond. The normal
O–O and O=O bond lengths are 148 pm
and 121 pm respectively. Experimentally
determined oxygen-oxygen bond lengths in
the O3 molecule are same (128 pm). Thus the
oxygen-oxygen bonds in the O3 molecule are
intermediate between a double and a single
bond. Obviously, this cannot be represented
by either of the two Lewis structures shown
above.
The concept of resonance was introduced
to deal with the type of difficulty experienced
in the depiction of accurate structures of
molecules like O3. According to the concept
of resonance, whenever a single Lewis
structure cannot describe a molecule
accurately, a number of structures with
similar energy, positions of nuclei, bonding
and non-bonding pairs of electrons are
taken as the canonical structures of the
hybrid which describes the molecule
accurately. Thus for O3, the two structures
shown above constitute the canonical
structures or resonance structures and
their hybrid i.e., the III structure represents
the structure of O3 more accurately. This is
also called resonance hybrid. Resonance is
represented by a double headed arrow.

chemistry

Some of the other examples of resonance
structures are provided by the carbonate ion
and the carbon dioxide molecule.
Fig. 4.5

Problem 4.3
Explain the structure of CO32– ion in
terms of resonance.
Solution
The single Lewis structure based on
the presence of two single bonds and
one double bond between carbon
and oxygen atoms is inadequate to
represent the molecule accurately as it
represents unequal bonds. According
to the experimental findings, all carbon
to oxygen bonds in CO32– are equivalent.
Therefore the carbonate ion is best
described as a resonance hybrid of the
canonical forms I, II, and III shown below.

Fig. 4.4

Resonance in CO32–, I, II and III
represent the three canonical
forms.

Problem 4.4
Explain the structure of CO2 molecule.
Solution
The experimentally determined carbon
to oxygen bond length in CO 2 is
115 pm. The lengths of a normal
carbon to oxygen double bond (C=O)
and carbon to oxygen triple bond (C≡O)
are 121 pm and 110 pm respectively.
The carbon-oxygen bond lengths in
CO2 (115 pm) lie between the values
for C=O and C≡O. Obviously, a single
Lewis structure cannot depict this
position and it becomes necessary to
write more than one Lewis structures
and to consider that the structure of
CO2 is best described as a hybrid of
the canonical or resonance forms I, II
and III.

Resonance in CO 2 molecule, I, II
and III represent the three canonical
forms.

In general, it may be stated that
• Resonance stabilizes the molecule as the
energy of the resonance hybrid is less
than the energy of any single cannonical
structure; and,
• Resonance averages the bond
characteristics as a whole.
Thus the energy of the O 3 resonance
hybrid is lower than either of the two
cannonical froms I and II (Fig. 4.3).
Many misconceptions are associated
with resonance and the same need to be
dispelled. You should remember that :
• The cannonical forms have no real
existence.
• The molecule does not exist for a certain
fraction of time in one cannonical form
and for other fractions of time in other
cannonical forms.
• There is no such  equilibrium between
the cannonical forms as we have
between tautomeric forms (keto and
enol) in tautomerism.
• The molecule as such has a single
structure which is the resonance
hybrid of the cannonical forms and
which cannot as such be depicted by
a single Lewis structure.
4.3.6	Polarity of Bonds
The existence of a hundred percent ionic or
covalent bond represents an ideal situation.
In reality no bond or a compound is either
completely covalent or ionic. Even in case of
covalent bond between two hydrogen atoms,
there is some ionic character.
When covalent bond is formed between
two similar atoms, for example in H2, O2,
Cl2, N2 or F2, the shared pair of electrons is
equally attracted by the two atoms. As a result

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

electron pair is situated exactly between the
two identical nuclei. The bond so formed is
called nonpolar covalent bond. Contrary to
this in case of a heteronuclear molecule like
HF, the shared electron pair between the two
atoms gets displaced more towards fluorine
since the electronegativity of fluorine (Unit 3)
is far greater than that of hydrogen. The
resultant covalent bond is a polar covalent
bond.
As a result of polarisation, the molecule
possesses the dipole moment (depicted
below) which can be defined as the product of
the magnitude of the charge and the distance
between the centres of positive and negative
charge. It is usually designated by a Greek
letter ‘µ’. Mathematically, it is expressed as
follows :
Dipole moment (µ) = charge (Q) × distance of
                                                separation (r)
Dipole moment is usually expressed in
Debye units (D). The conversion factor is
1 D = 3.33564 × 10–30 C m
where C is coulomb and m is meter.
Further dipole moment is a vector quantity
and by convention it is depicted by a small
arrow with tail on the negative centre and
head pointing towards the positive centre.
But in chemistry presence of dipole moment
is represented by the crossed arrow (
)
put on Lewis structure of the molecule. The
cross is on positive end and arrow head is on
negative end. For example the dipole moment
of HF may be represented as :
H         F
This arrow symbolises the direction of the
shift of electron density in the molecule. Note
that the direction of crossed arrow is opposite
to the conventional direction of dipole moment
vector.
Peter Debye, the Dutch chemist
received Nobel prize in 1936 for
his work on X-ray diffraction and
dipole moments. The magnitude
of the dipole moment is given in
Debye units in order to honour him.

In case of polyatomic molecules the dipole
moment not only depend upon the individual
dipole moments of bonds known as bond
dipoles but also on the spatial arrangement
of various bonds in the molecule. In such
case, the dipole moment of a molecule is the
vector sum of the dipole moments of various
bonds. For example in H2O molecule, which
has a bent structure, the two O–H bonds are
oriented at an angle of 104.50. Net dipole
moment of 6.17 × 10–30 C m (1D = 3.33564
× 10–30 C m) is the resultant of the dipole
moments of two O–H bonds.

Net Dipole moment, µ = 1.85 D
= 1.85 × 3.33564 × 10–30 C m = 6.17 ×10–30 C m
The dipole moment in case of BeF2 is zero.
This is because the two equal bond dipoles
point in opposite directions and cancel the
effect of each other.

In tetra-atomic molecule, for example in
BF3, the dipole moment is zero although the
B – F bonds are oriented at an angle of 120o
to one another, the three bond moments give
a net sum of zero as the resultant of any two
is equal and opposite to the third.

Let us study an interesting case of NH3
and NF3 molecule. Both the molecules have

dipole moment of NH3 (4.90 × 10–30 C m) is
greater than that of NF3 (0.8 × 10–30 C m). This
is because, in case of NH3 the orbital dipole
due to lone pair is in the same direction as
the resultant dipole moment of the N – H
bonds, whereas in NF3 the orbital dipole is in
the direction opposite to the resultant dipole
moment of the three N–F bonds. The orbital
dipole because of lone pair decreases the effect
of the resultant N – F bond moments, which
results in the low dipole moment of NF3 as
represented below :

Dipole moments of some molecules are
shown in Table 4.5.
Just as all the covalent bonds have
some partial ionic character, the ionic
bonds also have partial covalent character.
The partial covalent character of ionic
bonds was discussed by Fajans in terms of
the following rules:

•
•
•

The smaller the size of the cation and the
larger the size of the anion, the greater
the covalent character of an ionic bond.
The greater the charge on the cation, the
greater the covalent character of the ionic
bond.
For cations of the same size and charge,
the one, with electronic configuration
(n-1)dnnso, typical of transition metals, is
more polarising than the one with a noble
gas configuration, ns2 np6, typical of alkali
and alkaline earth metal cations.
The cation polarises the anion, pulling
the electronic charge toward itself and
thereby increasing the electronic charge
between the two. This is precisely what
happens in a covalent bond, i.e., buildup
of electron charge density between the
nuclei. The polarising power of the cation,
the polarisability of the anion and the
extent of distortion (polarisation) of anion
are the factors, which determine the per
cent covalent character of the ionic bond.

Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) Theory
As already explained, Lewis concept is unable
to explain the shapes of molecules. This
theory provides a simple procedure to predict
the shapes of covalent molecules. Sidgwick

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

and Powell in 1940, proposed a simple theory
based on the repulsive interactions of the
electron pairs in the valence shell of the
atoms. It was further developed and redefined
by Nyholm and Gillespie (1957).
The main postulates of VSEPR theory are
as follows:

•

The shape of a molecule depends upon
the number of valence shell electron pairs
(bonded or nonbonded) around the central
atom.

•

Pairs of electrons in the valence shell repel
one another since their electron clouds are
negatively charged.

•

These pairs of electrons tend to occupy
such positions in space that minimise
repulsion and thus maximise distance
between them.

•

The valence shell is taken as a sphere
with the electron pairs localising on the
spherical surface at maximum distance
from one another.

•

A multiple bond is treated as if it is a single
electron pair and the two or three electron
pairs of a multiple bond are treated as a
single super pair.

•

Where two or more resonance structures
can represent a molecule, the VSEPR
model is applicable to any such structure.

result in deviations from idealised shapes and
alterations in bond angles in molecules.
For the prediction of geometrical shapes
of molecules with the help of VSEPR theory,
it is convenient to divide molecules into
two categories as (i) molecules in which
the central atom has no lone pair and
(ii) molecules in which the central atom
has one or more lone pairs.
Table 4.6 (page114) shows the
arrangement of electron pairs about a
central atom A (without any lone pairs) and
geometries of some molecules/ions of the type
AB. Table 4.7 (page 115) shows shapes of some
simple molecules and ions in which the central
atom has one or more lone pairs. Table 4.8
(page 116) explains the reasons for the
distortions in the geometry of the molecule.
As depicted in Table 4.6, in the
compounds of AB2, AB3, AB4, AB5 and AB6,
the arrangement of electron pairs and the
B atoms around the central atom A are :
linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral,
trigonal-bipyramidal and octahedral,
respectively. Such arrangement can be seen
in the molecules like BF3 (AB3), CH4 (AB4) and
PCl5 (AB5) as depicted below by their ball and
stick models.

The repulsive interaction of electron pairs
decrease in the order:
Lone pair (lp) – Lone pair (lp) > Lone pair
(lp) – Bond pair (bp) > Bond pair (bp) –
Bond pair (bp)

Fig. 4.6

Nyholm and Gillespie (1957) refined the
VSEPR model by explaining the important
difference between the lone pairs and bonding
pairs of electrons. While the lone pairs are
localised on the central atom, each bonded
pair is shared between two atoms. As a result,
the lone pair electrons in a molecule occupy
more space as compared to the bonding pairs
of electrons. This results in greater repulsion
between lone pairs of electrons as compared
to the lone pair - bond pair and bond pair bond pair repulsions. These repulsion effects

The VSEPR Theory is able to predict
geometry of a large number of molecules,
especially the compounds of p-block elements
accurately. It is also quite successful in
determining the geometry quite-accurately
even when the energy difference between
possible structures is very small. The
theoretical basis of the VSEPR theory regarding
the effects of electron pair repulsions on
molecular shapes is not clear and continues
to be a subject of doubt and discussion.

The shape should have been
tetrahedral if there were all bp
but two lp are present so the
shape is distorted tetrahedral

lp-lp repulsion is more than
lp-bp repulsion which is more
than bp-bp repulsion. Thus,
the angle is reduced to 104.5°
from 109.5°.

In (a) the lp is present at axial

lp—bp repulsions at 90°.
In(b) the lp is in an equatorial

lp—bp repulsions. Hence,
arrangement (b) is more
stable. The shape shown in

Similarly the VSEPR theory gives the
geometry of simple molecules but theoretically,
it does not explain them and also it has limited
applications. To overcome these limitations
the two important theories based on quantum
mechanical principles are introduced. These
are valence bond (VB) theory and molecular
orbital (MO) theory.

of the valence bond theory is based on the
knowledge of atomic orbitals, electronic
configurations of elements (Units 2), the
overlap criteria of atomic orbitals, the
hybridization of atomic orbitals and the
principles of variation and superposition. A
rigorous treatment of the VB theory in terms
of these aspects is beyond the scope of this
book. Therefore, for the sake of convenience,
valence bond theory has been discussed in
terms of qualitative and non-mathematical
treatment only. To start with, let us consider
the formation of hydrogen molecule which is
the simplest of all molecules.
Consider two hydrogen atoms A and B
approaching each other having nuclei NA
and NB and electrons present in them are
represented by eA and eB. When the two atoms
are at large distance from each other, there
is no interaction between them. As these two
atoms approach each other, new attractive
and repulsive forces begin to operate.

Valence bond theory was introduced
by Heitler and London (1927) and developed
further by Pauling and others. A discussion

Attractive forces arise between:
(i)
nucleus of one atom and its own electron
that is NA – eA and NB– eB.

As we know that Lewis approach helps in
writing the structure of molecules but it
fails to explain the formation of chemical
bond. It also does not give any reason for the
difference in bond dissociation enthalpies and
bond lengths in molecules like H2 (435.8 kJ
mol-1, 74 pm) and F2 (155 kJ mol-1, 144 pm),
although in both the cases a single covalent
bond is formed by the sharing of an electron
pair between the respective atoms. It also
gives no idea about the shapes of polyatomic
molecules.

(ii)

together to form a stable molecule having the
bond length of 74 pm.
Since the energy gets released when the
bond is formed between two hydrogen atoms,
the hydrogen molecule is more stable than
that of isolated hydrogen atoms. The energy
so released is called as bond enthalpy, which
is corresponding to minimum in the curve
depicted in Fig. 4.8. Conversely, 435.8 kJ of
energy is required to dissociate one mole of
H2 molecule.
H2(g) + 435.8 kJ mol–1 → H(g) + H(g)

nucleus of one atom and electron of
other atom i.e., NA– eB, NB– eA.
Similarly repulsive forces arise between
(i)
electrons of two atoms like eA – eB,
(ii) nuclei of two atoms NA – NB.
Attractive forces tend to bring the two
atoms close to each other whereas repulsive
forces tend to push them apart (Fig. 4.7).

formation of H2 molecule as a function
of internuclear distance of the H atoms.
The minimum in the curve corresponds
to the most stable state of H2.

4.5.1 Orbital Overlap Concept

Fig. 4.7

Forces of attraction and repulsion
during the formation of H2 molecule

Experimentally it has been found that
the magnitude of new attractive force is
more than the new repulsive forces. As a
result, two atoms approach each other and
potential energy decreases. Ultimately a stage
is reached where the net force of attraction
balances the force of repulsion and system
acquires minimum energy. At this stage
two hydrogen atoms are said to be bonded

In the formation of hydrogen molecule,
there is a minimum energy state when two
hydrogen atoms are so near that their atomic
orbitals undergo partial interpenetration. This
partial merging of atomic orbitals is called
overlapping of atomic orbitals which results in
the pairing of electrons. The extent of overlap
decides the strength of a covalent bond. In
general, greater the overlap the stronger is the
bond formed between two atoms. Therefore,
according to orbital overlap concept, the
formation of a covalent bond between two
atoms results by pairing of electrons present
in the valence shell having opposite spins.

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

4.5.2 Directional Properties of Bonds
As we have already seen, the covalent bond
is formed by overlapping of atomic orbitals.
The molecule of hydrogen is formed due to the
overlap of 1s-orbitals of two H atoms.
In case of polyatomic molecules like CH4,
NH3 and H2O, the geometry of the molecules
is also important in addition to the bond
formation. For example why is it so that CH4
molecule has tetrahedral shape and HCH
bond angles are 109.5°? Why is the shape of
NH3 molecule pyramidal ?
The valence bond theory explains the
shape, the formation and directional properties
of bonds in polyatomic molecules like CH4,
NH3 and H2O, etc. in terms of overlap and
hybridisation of atomic orbitals.
4.5.3 Overlapping of Atomic Orbitals
When orbitals of two atoms come close to form
bond, their overlap may be positive, negative
or zero depending upon the sign (phase) and
direction of orientation of amplitude of orbital
wave function in space (Fig. 4.9). Positive and
negative sign on boundary surface diagrams
in the Fig. 4.9 show the sign (phase) of orbital
wave function and are not related to charge.
Orbitals forming bond should have same sign
(phase) and orientation in space. This is called
positive overlap. Various overlaps of s and p
orbitals are depicted in Fig. 4.9.
The criterion of overlap, as the main factor
for the formation of covalent bonds applies
uniformly to the homonuclear/heteronuclear
diatomic molecules and polyatomic molecules.
We know that the shapes of CH4, NH3, and
H2O molecules are tetrahedral, pyramidal
and bent respectively. It would be therefore
interesting to use VB theory to find out if these
geometrical shapes can be explained in terms
of the orbital overlaps.
Let us first consider the CH4 (methane)
molecule. The electronic configuration of
carbon in its ground state is [He]2s2 2p2 which
in the excited state becomes [He] 2s1 2px1 2py1
2pz1. The energy required for this excitation is
compensated by the release of energy due to
overlap between the orbitals of carbon and the

Fig.4.9

Positive, negative and zero overlaps of
s and p atomic orbitals

hydrogen. The four atomic orbitals of carbon,
each with an unpaired electron can overlap
with the 1s orbitals of the four H atoms which
are also singly occupied. This will result in the
formation of four C-H bonds. It will, however,
be observed that while the three p orbitals of
carbon are at 90° to one another, the HCH
angle for these will also be 90°. That is three
C-H bonds will be oriented at 90° to one
another. The 2s orbital of carbon and the 1s
orbital of H are spherically symmetrical and
they can overlap in any direction. Therefore
the direction of the fourth C-H bond cannot
be ascertained. This description does not fit
in with the tetrahedral HCH angles of 109.5°.
Clearly, it follows that simple atomic orbital
overlap does not account for the directional
characteristics of bonds in CH4. Using similar
procedure and arguments, it can be seen that in
the case of NH3 and H2O molecules, the HNH

120

chemistry

and HOH angles should be 90°. This is in
disagreement with the actual bond angles of
107° and 104.5° in the NH3 and H2O molecules
respectively.
4.5.4	Types of Overlapping and Nature of
Covalent Bonds
The covalent bond may be classified into
two types depending upon the types of
overlapping:
(i) Sigma(σ) bond, and (ii) pi(π) bond
(i)
Sigma(σ) bond : This type of covalent
bond is formed by the end to end (headon) overlap of bonding orbitals along the
internuclear axis. This is called as head
on overlap or axial overlap. This can be
formed by any one of the following types
of combinations of atomic orbitals.

•

s-s overlapping : In this case, there is
overlap of two half filled s-orbitals along
the internuclear axis as shown below :

above and below the plane of the
participating atoms.

4.5.5 Strength of Sigma and pi Bonds
Basically the strength of a bond depends
upon the extent of overlapping. In case of
sigma bond, the overlapping of orbitals takes
place to a larger extent. Hence, it is stronger
as compared to the pi bond where the extent
of overlapping occurs to a smaller extent.
Further, it is important to note that in the
formation of multiple bonds between two
atoms of a molecule, pi bond(s) is formed in
addition to a sigma bond.
4.6

•

s-p overlapping: This type of overlap
occurs between half filled s-orbitals of one
atom and half filled p-orbitals of another
atom.

•

p–p overlapping : This type of overlap
takes place between half filled p-orbitals
of the two approaching atoms.

(ii)

pi( ) bond : In the formation of π bond
the atomic orbitals overlap in such a
way that their axes remain parallel to
each other and perpendicular to the
internuclear axis. The orbitals formed
due to sidewise overlapping consists
of two saucer type charged clouds

Hybridisation

In order to explain the characteristic
geometrical shapes of polyatomic molecules
like CH4, NH3 and H2O etc., Pauling introduced
the concept of hybridisation. According to him
the atomic orbitals combine to form new set of
equivalent orbitals known as hybrid orbitals.
Unlike pure orbitals, the hybrid orbitals are
used in bond formation. The phenomenon is
known as hybridisation which can be defined
as the process of intermixing of the orbitals of
slightly different energies so as to redistribute
their energies, resulting in the formation of
new set of orbitals of equivalent energies and
shape. For example when one 2s and three
2p-orbitals of carbon hybridise, there is the
formation of four new sp3 hybrid orbitals.
Salient features of hybridisation: The main
features of hybridisation are as under :
1. The number of hybrid orbitals is equal to
the number of the atomic orbitals that get
hybridised.
2. The hybridised orbitals are always
equivalent in energy and shape.



Unit 4.indd 120

9/12/2022 9:36:14 AM

121

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

3. The hybrid orbitals are more effective in
forming stable bonds than the pure atomic
orbitals.
4. These hybrid orbitals are directed in
space in some preferred direction to have
minimum repulsion between electron
pairs and thus a stable arrangement.
Therefore, the type of hybridisation
indicates the geometry of the molecules.
Important conditions for hybridisation
(i)
The orbitals present in the valence shell
of the atom are hybridised.
(ii) The orbitals undergoing hybridisation
should have almost equal energy.
(iii) Promotion of electron is not essential
condition prior to hybridisation.
(iv) It is not necessary that only half filled
orbitals participate in hybridisation.
In some cases, even filled orbitals of
valence shell take part in hybridisation.
4.6.1 Types of Hybridisation
There are various types of hybridisation
involving s, p and d orbitals. The different
types of hybridisation are as under:
(I) sp hybridisation: This type of hybridisation
involves the mixing of one s and one p orbital
resulting in the formation of two equivalent
sp hybrid orbitals. The suitable orbitals for
sp hybridisation are s and pz, if the hybrid
orbitals are to lie along the z-axis. Each sp
hybrid orbitals has 50% s-character and
50% p-character. Such a molecule in which
the central atom is sp-hybridised and linked
directly to two other central atoms possesses
linear geometry. This type of hybridisation is
also known as diagonal hybridisation.
The two sp hybrids point in the opposite
direction along the z-axis with projecting
positive lobes and very small negative lobes,
which provides more effective overlapping
resulting in the formation of stronger bonds.

configuration of Be is 1s22s2. In the exited
state one of the 2s-electrons is promoted to

vacant 2p orbital to account for its bivalency.
One 2s and one 2p-orbital gets hybridised to
form two sp hybridised orbitals. These two
sp hybrid orbitals are oriented in opposite
direction forming an angle of 180°. Each of
the sp hybridised orbital overlaps with the
2p-orbital of chlorine axially and form two BeCl sigma bonds. This is shown in Fig. 4.10.

p orbitals; (b) Formation of the linear
BeCl2 molecule

(II) sp2 hybridisation : In this hybridisation
there is involvement of one s and two
p-orbitals in order to form three equivalent
sp 2 hybridised orbitals. For example, in
BCl3 molecule, the ground state electronic
configuration of central boron atom is
1s22s22p1. In the excited state, one of the 2s
electrons is promoted to vacant 2p orbital as

chemistry

a result boron has three unpaired electrons.
These three orbitals (one 2s and two 2p)
hybridise to form three sp2 hybrid orbitals.
The three hybrid orbitals so formed are
oriented in a trigonal planar arrangement
and overlap with 2p orbitals of chlorine to
form three B-Cl bonds. Therefore, in BCl3
(Fig. 4.11), the geometry is trigonal planar
with ClBCl bond angle of 120°.
(III) sp 3 hybridisation: This type of
hybridisation can be explained by taking the
example of CH4 molecule in which there is
mixing of one s-orbital and three p-orbitals
of the valence shell to form four sp3 hybrid
orbital of equivalent energies and shape. There
is 25% s-character and 75% p-character in
each sp3 hybrid orbital. The four sp3 hybrid
orbitals so formed are directed towards the
four corners of the tetrahedron. The angle
between sp3 hybrid orbital is 109.5° as shown
in Fig. 4.12.

ground state is 2S 2 p x 2 py 2 p z having three
unpaired electrons in the sp3 hybrid orbitals
and a lone pair of electrons is present in the
fourth one. These three hybrid orbitals overlap
with 1s orbitals of hydrogen atoms to form
three N–H sigma bonds. We know that the
force of repulsion between a lone pair and a
bond pair is more than the force of repulsion
between two bond pairs of electrons. The
molecule thus gets distorted and the bond
angle is reduced to 107° from 109.5°. The
geometry of such a molecule will be pyramidal
as shown in Fig. 4.13.

Fig.4.13

In case of H2O molecule, the four oxygen
orbitals (one 2s and three 2p) undergo sp3
hybridisation forming four sp3 hybrid orbitals
out of which two contain one electron each and
the other two contain a pair of electrons. These
four sp3 hybrid orbitals acquire a tetrahedral
geometry, with two corners occupied by
hydrogen atoms while the other two by the
lone pairs. The bond angle in this case is
reduced to 104.5° from 109.5° (Fig. 4.14)  
and the molecule thus acquires  a V-shape or
angular geometry.

4.6.2 Other Examples of sp3, sp2 and sp
Hybridisation
sp3 Hybridisation in C2H6 molecule: In
ethane molecule both the carbon atoms
assume sp3 hybrid state. One of the four
sp3 hybrid orbitals of carbon atom overlaps
axially with similar orbitals of other atom to
form sp3-sp3 sigma bond while the other three
hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom are used
in forming sp3–s sigma bonds with hydrogen
atoms as discussed in section 4.6.1(iii).
Therefore in ethane C–C bond length is 154
pm and each C–H bond length is 109 pm.
sp2 Hybridisation in C2H4: In the formation
of ethene molecule, one of the sp2 hybrid
orbitals of carbon atom overlaps axially with
sp2 hybridised orbital of another carbon atom
to form C–C sigma bond. While the other two
sp2 hybrid orbitals of each carbon atom are

Fig. 4.15

used for making sp2–s sigma bond with two
hydrogen atoms. The unhybridised orbital (2px
or 2py) of one carbon atom overlaps sidewise
with the similar orbital of the other carbon
atom to form weak π bond, which consists of
two equal electron clouds distributed above
and below the plane of carbon and hydrogen
atoms.
Thus, in ethene molecule, the carboncarbon bond consists of one sp2–sp2 sigma
bond and one pi (π ) bond between p orbitals
which are not used in the hybridisation and
are perpendicular to the plane of molecule; the
bond length 134 pm. The C–H bond is sp2–s
sigma with bond length 108 pm. The H–C–H
bond angle is 117.6° while the H–C–C angle
is 121°. The formation of sigma and pi bonds
in ethene is shown in Fig. 4.15.

sp Hybridisation in C2H2 : In the formation
of ethyne molecule, both the carbon atoms
undergo sp-hybridisation having two
unhybridised orbital i.e., 2py and 2px.
One sp hybrid orbital of one carbon atom
overlaps axially with sp hybrid orbital of the
other carbon atom to form C–C sigma bond,
while the other hybridised orbital of each
carbon atom overlaps axially with the half
filled s orbital of hydrogen atoms forming
σ bonds. Each of the two unhybridised p
orbitals of both the carbon atoms overlaps
sidewise to form two π bonds between the
carbon atoms. So the triple bond between the
two carbon atoms is made up of one sigma
and two pi bonds as shown in Fig. 4.16.

4.6.3 Hybridisation of Elements
involving d Orbitals
The elements present in the third period
contain d orbitals in addition to s and p
orbitals. The energy of the 3d orbitals are
comparable to the energy of the 3s and 3p
orbitals. The energy of 3d orbitals are also
comparable to those of 4s and 4p orbitals.
As a consequence the hybridisation involving
either 3s, 3p and 3d or 3d, 4s and 4p is
possible. However, since the difference in
energies of 3p and 4s orbitals is significant, no
hybridisation involving 3p, 3d and 4s orbitals
is possible.
The important hybridisation schemes
involving s, p and d orbitals are summarised

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

Now the five orbitals (i.e., one s, three
p and one d orbitals) are available for
hybridisation to yield a set of five sp3d hybrid
orbitals which are directed towards the five
corners of a trigonal bipyramidal as depicted
in the Fig. 4.17.

six sp3d2 hybrid orbitals overlap with singly
occupied orbitals of fluorine atoms to form
six S–F sigma bonds. Thus SF6 molecule has
a regular octahedral geometry as shown in
Fig. 4.18.

molecule

It should be noted that all the bond angles
in trigonal bipyramidal geometry are not
equivalent. In PCl5 the five sp3d orbitals of
phosphorus overlap with the singly occupied
p orbitals of chlorine atoms to form five P–Cl
sigma bonds. Three P–Cl bond lie in one
plane and make an angle of 120° with each
other; these bonds are termed as equatorial
bonds. The remaining two P–Cl bonds–one
lying above and the other lying below the
equatorial plane, make an angle of 90° with
the plane. These bonds are called axial bonds.
As the axial bond pairs suffer more repulsive
interaction from the equatorial bond pairs,
therefore axial bonds have been found to
be slightly longer and hence slightly weaker
than the equatorial bonds; which makes PCl5
molecule more reactive.
(ii) Formation of SF6 (sp3d2 hybridisation):
In SF6 the central sulphur atom has the
ground state outer electronic configuration
3s23p4. In the exited state the available six
orbitals i.e., one s, three p and two d are
singly occupied by electrons. These orbitals
hybridise to form six new sp 3 d 2 hybrid
orbitals, which are projected towards the six
corners of a regular octahedron in SF6. These

Molecular Orbital Theory

Molecular orbital (MO) theory was developed
by F. Hund and R.S. Mulliken in 1932. The
salient features of this theory are :
(i)

The electrons in a molecule are present
in the various molecular orbitals as the
electrons of atoms are present in the
various atomic orbitals.

(ii)

The atomic orbitals of comparable
energies and proper symmetry combine
to form molecular orbitals.

(iii)

While an electron in an atomic orbital
is influenced by one nucleus, in a
molecular orbital it is influenced by
two or more nuclei depending upon the
number of atoms in the molecule. Thus,



Unit 4.indd 125

9/12/2022 9:36:17 AM

126

chemistry

an atomic orbital is monocentric while
a molecular orbital is polycentric.
(iv)

The number of molecular orbital formed
is equal to the number of combining
atomic orbitals. When two atomic
orbitals combine, two molecular orbitals
are formed. One is known as bonding
molecular orbital while the other is
called antibonding molecular orbital.

(v)

The bonding molecular orbital has  
lower energy and hence greater stability
than the corresponding antibonding
molecular orbital.

(vi)

Just as the electron probability
distribution around a nucleus in an
atom is given by an atomic orbital, the
electron probability distribution around
a group of nuclei in a molecule is given
by a molecular orbital.

ψA and ψB. Mathematically, the formation of
molecular orbitals may be described by the
linear combination of atomic orbitals that can
take place by addition and by subtraction of
wave functions of individual atomic orbitals
as shown below :
ψMO = ψA + ψB
Therefore, the two molecular orbitals
σ and σ* are formed as :
σ = ψA + ψB
σ* = ψA – ψB
The molecular orbital σ formed by the
addition of atomic orbitals is called the bonding
molecular orbital while the molecular orbital
σ* formed by the subtraction of atomic orbital
is called antibonding molecular orbital as
depicted in Fig. 4.19.

(vii) The molecular orbitals like atomic
orbitals are filled in accordance with
the aufbau principle obeying the Pauli’s
exclusion principle and the Hund’s rule.
4.7.1 Formation of Molecular Orbitals
Linear Combination of Atomic
Orbitals (LCAO)
According to wave mechanics, the atomic
orbitals can be expressed by wave functions
(ψ ’s) which represent the amplitude of the
electron waves. These are obtained from
the solution of Schrödinger wave equation.
However, since it cannot be solved for any
system containing more than one electron,
molecular orbitals which are one electron
wave functions for molecules are difficult
to obtain directly from the solution of
Schrödinger wave equation. To overcome
this problem, an approximate method known
as linear combination of atomic orbitals
(LCAO) has been adopted.
Let us apply this method to the
homonuclear diatomic hydrogen molecule.
Consider the hydrogen molecule consisting
of two atoms A and B. Each hydrogen atom
in the ground state has one electron in 1s
orbital. The atomic orbitals of these atoms
may be represented by the wave functions

σ* = ψA – ψB

ψB

ψA
σ = ψA + ψB

Fig.4.19

Formation of bonding (σ) and antibonding
(σ*) molecular orbitals by the linear
combination of atomic orbitals ψA and
ψB centered on two atoms A and B
respectively.

Qualitatively, the formation of molecular
orbitals can be understood in terms of the
constructive or destructive interference of the
electron waves of the combining atoms. In the
formation of bonding molecular orbital, the
two electron waves of the bonding atoms
reinforce each other due to constructive
interference while in the formation of



Unit 4.indd 126

9/12/2022 9:36:17 AM

127

Chemical Bonding And Molecular Structure

antibonding molecular orbital, the electron
waves cancel each other due to destructive
interference. As a result, the electron density in
a bonding molecular orbital is located between
the nuclei of the bonded atoms because of
which the repulsion between the nuclei is very
less while in case of an antibonding molecular
orbital, most of the electron density is located
away from the space between the nuclei.
Infact, there is a nodal plane (on which the
electron density is zero) between the nuclei
and hence the repulsion between the nuclei is
high. Electrons placed in a bonding molecular
orbital tend to hold the nuclei together and
stabilise a molecule. Therefore, a bonding
molecular orbital always possesses lower
energy than either of the atomic orbitals that
have combined to form it. In contrast, the
electrons placed in the antibonding molecular
orbital destabilise the molecule. This is
because the mutual repulsion of the electrons
in this orbital is more than the attraction
between the electrons and the nuclei, which
causes a net increase in energy.
It may be noted that the energy of the
antibonding orbital is raised above the
energy of the parent atomic orbitals that
have combined and the energy of the bonding
orbital has been lowered than the parent
orbitals. The total energy of two molecular
orbitals, however, remains the same as that
of two original atomic orbitals.
4.7.2 Conditions for the Combination of
Atomic Orbitals
The linear combination of atomic orbitals to
form molecular orbitals takes place only if the
following conditions are satisfied:
1.	The combining atomic orbitals must
have the same or nearly the same energy.
This means that 1s orbital can combine with
another 1s orbital but not with 2s orbital
because the energy of 2s orbital is appreciably
higher than that of 1s orbital. This is not true
if the atoms are very different.
2.	The combining atomic orbitals must
have the same symmetry about the
molecular axis. By convention z-axis is taken

as the molecular axis. It is important to note
that atomic orbitals having same or nearly
the same energy will not combine if they do
not have the same symmetry. For example,
2pz orbital of one atom can combine with 2pz
orbital of the other atom but not with the
2px or 2py orbitals because of their different
symmetries.
3.	The combining atomic orbitals must
overlap to the maximum extent. Greater
the extent of overlap, the greater will be the
electron-density between the nuclei of a
molecular orbital.
4.7.3	Types of Molecular Orbitals
Molecular orbitals of diatomic molecules are
designated as σ (sigma), π (pi), δ (delta), etc.
In this nomenclature, the sigma ( )
molecular orbitals are symmetrical around
the bond-axis while pi ( ) molecular orbitals
are not symmetrical. For example, the linear
combination of 1s orbitals centered on two
nuclei produces two molecular orbitals which
are symmetrical around the bond-axis. Such
molecular orbitals are of the σ type and are
designated as σ1s and σ*1s [Fig. 4.20(a), page
124]. If internuclear axis is taken to be in
the z-direction, it can be seen that a linear
combination of 2pz- orbitals of two atoms
also produces two sigma molecular orbitals
designated as 2pz and *2pz. [Fig. 4.20(b)]

Molecular orbitals obtained from 2px and
2py orbitals are not symmetrical around the
bond axis because of the presence of positive
lobes above and negative lobes below the
molecular plane. Such molecular orbitals,
are labelled as π and =π * [Fig. 4.20(c)]. A
π bonding MO has larger electron density
above and below the inter-nuclear axis. The
π* antibonding MO has a node between the
nuclei.

4.7.4 Energy Level Diagram for Molecular
Orbitals
We have seen that 1s atomic orbitals on two
atoms form two molecular orbitals designated
as σ1s and σ*1s. In the same manner, the 2s
and 2p atomic orbitals (eight atomic orbitals

The energy levels of these molecular

from spectroscopic data for homonuclear

of the periodic table. The increasing order of

129

energies of various molecular orbitals for O2
and F2 is given below:
1s <  ∗1s <  2s <  ∗2s < 2pz < (π 2px=π 2py)
< (π ∗2px= π∗ 2py) <  ∗2pz

However, this sequence of energy levels
of molecular orbitals is not correct for the
remaining molecules Li2, Be2, B2, C2, N2. For
instance, it has been observed experimentally
that  for  molecules such as B2, C2, N2, etc.
the increasing order of energies of various
molecular orbitals is
1s <  ∗1s < 2s <  ∗2s < (π 2 px = π 2 py)

< 2pz < (π ∗2px =π∗2py) <  ∗2pz

The important characteristic feature
of this order is that the energy of 2p z
molecular orbital is higher than that
of 2px and 2py molecular orbitals.
4.7.5 Electronic Configuration and
Molecular Behaviour
The distribution of electrons among various
molecular orbitals is called the electronic
configuration of the molecule. From the
electronic configuration of the molecule, it is
possible to get important information about
the molecule as discussed below.
Stability of Molecules: If Nb is the number
of electrons occupying bonding orbitals and
Na the number occupying the antibonding
orbitals, then
(i)

the molecule is stable if Nb is greater
than Na, and

(ii)

the molecule is unstable if Nb is less
than Na.

In (i) more bonding orbitals are occupied
and so the bonding influence is stronger and a
stable molecule results. In (ii) the antibonding
influence is stronger and therefore the
molecule is unstable.
Bond order
Bond order (b.o.) is defined as one half the
difference between the number of electrons
present in the bonding and the antibonding
orbitals i.e.,
Bond order (b.o.) = ½ (Nb–Na)

The rules discussed above regarding the
stability of the molecule can be restated in
terms of bond order as follows: A positive bond
order (i.e., Nb > Na) means a stable molecule
while a negative (i.e., Nb<Na) or zero (i.e.,
N b = N a) bond order means an unstable
molecule.
Nature of the bond
Integral bond order values of 1, 2 or 3
correspond to single, double or triple bonds
respectively as studied in the classical
concept.
Bond-length
The bond order between two atoms in a
molecule may be taken as an approximate
measure of the bond length. The bond length
decreases as bond order increases.
Magnetic nature
If all the molecular orbitals in a molecule are
doubly occupied, the substance is diamagnetic
(repelled by magnetic field). However if one or
more molecular orbitals are singly occupied it
is paramagnetic (attracted by magnetic field),
e.g., O2 molecule.
4.8

BONDING IN SOME HOMONUCLEAR
DIATOMIC MOLECULES
In this section we shall discuss bonding in
some homonuclear diatomic molecules.
1. Hydrogen molecule (H2 ): It is formed by
the combination of two hydrogen atoms. Each
hydrogen atom has one electron in 1s orbital.
Therefore, in all there are two electrons in
hydrogen molecule which are present in σ1s
molecular orbital. So electronic configuration
of hydrogen molecule is
H2 : (σ1s)2
The bond order of H2 molecule can be
calculated as given below:

N b  Na 2  0

1
2
2
This means that the two hydrogen atoms
are bonded together by a single covalent bond.
The bond dissociation energy of hydrogen
molecule has been found to be 438 kJ mol–1
and bond length equal to 74 pm. Since no
Bond order =



Unit 4.indd 129

130

chemistry

unpaired electron is present in hydrogen
molecule, therefore, it is diamagnetic.
2. Helium molecule (He2 ): The electronic
configuration of helium atom is 1s2. Each
helium atom contains 2 electrons, therefore,
in He2 molecule there would be 4 electrons.
These electrons will be accommodated in
σ1s and σ*1s molecular orbitals leading to
electronic configuration:
He2 : (σ1s)2 (σ*1s)2
Bond order of He2 is ½(2 – 2) = 0
He2 molecule is therefore unstable and
does not exist.
Similarly, it can be shown that Be2 molecule
(σ1s)2 (σ*1s)2 (σ2s)2 (σ*2s)2 also does not exist.
3. Lithium molecule (Li2 ): The electronic
configuration of lithium is 1s2, 2s1. There
are six electrons in Li 2 . The electronic
configuration of Li2 molecule, therefore, is
Li2 : (σ1s)2 (σ*1s)2 (σ2s)2
The above configuration is also written
as KK(σ2s)2 where KK represents the closed
K shell structure (σ1s)2 (σ*1s)2.
From the electronic configuration of Li2
molecule it is clear that there are four electrons
present in bonding molecular orbitals and two
electrons present in antibonding molecular
orbitals. Its bond order, therefore, is ½ (4 –
2) = 1. It means that Li2 molecule is stable
and since it has no unpaired electrons it
should be diamagnetic.  Indeed diamagnetic
Li 2 molecules are known to exist in the
vapour phase.
4. Carbon molecule (C2 ): The electronic
configuration of carbon is 1s2 2s2 2p2. There
are twelve electrons in C2. The electronic
configuration of C2 molecule, therefore, is
C2 : (1s)2 ( ∗1s)2 ( ∗ 2s)2 (π2p2x = π2p2y)
or KK (2s)2 ( ∗ 2s)2 (π2p2x = π2p2y)
The bond order of C2 is ½ (8 – 4) = 2
and C2 should be diamagnetic. Diamagnetic
C2 molecules have indeed been detected in

vapour phase. It is important to note that
double bond in C2 consists of both pi bonds
because of the presence of four electrons in
two pi molecular orbitals. In most of the other
molecules a double bond is made up of a
sigma bond and a pi bond. In a similar fashion
the bonding in N2 molecule can be discussed.
5. Oxygen molecule (O2 ): The electronic
configuration of oxygen atom is 1s2 2s2 2p4.
Each oxygen atom has 8 electrons, hence,
in O2 molecule there are 16 electrons. The
electronic configuration of O 2 molecule,
therefore, is
O 2 : (1s) 2 ( ∗1s) 2 ( 2s) 2 ( ∗ 2s) 2 (2p z) 2
(π2px2 ≡ π2py2) (π∗2p1x ≡ π ∗2py1)
O2 :
From the electronic configuration of O2
molecule it is clear that ten electrons are
present in bonding molecular orbitals and six
electrons are present in antibonding molecular
orbitals. Its bond order, therefore, is
Bond order =

[Nb – Na] =

[10 – 6] =2

So in oxygen molecule, atoms are held
by a double bond. Moreover, it may be noted
that it contains two unpaired electrons in
π ∗2px and π ∗2py molecular orbitals, therefore,
O 2 molecule should be paramagnetic,
a prediction that corresponds to
experimental observation. In this way, the
theory successfully explains the paramagnetic
nature of oxygen.
Similarly, the electronic configurations
of other homonuclear diatomic molecules of
the second row of the periodic table can be
written. In Fig. 4.21 are given the molecular
orbital occupancy and molecular properties
for B2 through Ne2. The sequence of MOs and
their electron population are shown. The bond
energy, bond length, bond order, magnetic
properties and valence electron configuration
appear below the orbital diagrams.

4.9 Hydrogen Bonding
Nitrogen, oxygen and fluorine are the highly
electronegative elements. When they are
attached to a hydrogen atom to form covalent
bond, the electrons of the covalent bond are  
shifted towards the more electronegative
atom. This partially positively charged
hydrogen atom forms a bond with the other
more electronegative atom. This bond is
known as hydrogen bond and is weaker
than the covalent bond. For example, in HF
molecule, the hydrogen bond exists between
hydrogen atom of one molecule and fluorine
atom of another molecule as depicted below :

– – – Hδ+–Fδ– – – –Hδ+ – Fδ– – – – Hδ+ – Fδ–
Here, hydrogen bond acts as a bridge between
two atoms which holds one atom by covalent
bond and the other by hydrogen bond.

Hydrogen bond is represented by a dotted
line (– – –) while a solid line represents the
covalent bond. Thus, hydrogen bond can be
defined as the attractive force which binds
hydrogen atom of one molecule with the
electronegative atom (F, O or N) of another
molecule.
4.9.1 Cause of Formation of Hydrogen
Bond
When hydrogen is bonded to strongly
electronegative element ‘X’, the electron pair
shared between the two atoms moves far
away from hydrogen atom. As a result the
hydrogen atom becomes highly electropositive
with respect to the other atom ‘X’. Since
there is displacement of electrons towards
X, the hydrogen acquires fractional positive
charge (δ +) while ‘X’ attain fractional negative

chemistry

charge (δ–). This results in the formation of a
polar molecule having electrostatic force of
attraction which can be represented as:

Hδ+ – Xδ– – – – Hδ+ – Xδ– – – – Hδ+ – Xδ–
The magnitude of H-bonding depends
on the physical state of the compound. It is
maximum in the solid state and minimum in
the gaseous state. Thus, the hydrogen bonds
have strong influence on the structure and
properties of the compounds.
4.9.2	Types of H-Bonds
There are two types of H-bonds
(i)
Intermolecular hydrogen bond
(ii) Intramolecular hydrogen bond
(1) Intermolecular hydrogen bond : It is
formed between two different molecules of the
same or different compounds. For example,

H-bond in case of HF molecule, alcohol or
water molecules, etc.
(2) Intramolecular hydrogen bond : It is
formed when hydrogen atom is in between
the two highly electronegative (F, O, N)
atoms present within the same molecule. For
example, in o-nitrophenol the hydrogen is in
between the two oxygen atoms.

Fig. 4.22 Intramolecular hydrogen bonding in
o-nitrophenol molecule

SUMMARY
Kössel’s first insight into the mechanism of formation of electropositive and electronegative
ions related the process to the attainment of noble gas configurations by the respective ions.
Electrostatic attraction between ions is the cause for their stability. This gives the concept
of electrovalency.
The first description of covalent bonding was provided by Lewis in terms of the sharing
of electron pairs between atoms and he related the process to the attainment of noble gas
configurations by reacting atoms as a result of sharing of electrons. The Lewis dot symbols
show the number of valence electrons of the atoms of a given element and Lewis dot structures
show pictorial representations of bonding in molecules.
An ionic compound is pictured as a three-dimensional aggregation of positive and negative
ions in an ordered arrangement called the crystal lattice. In a crystalline solid there is a
charge balance between the positive and negative ions. The crystal lattice is stabilized by
the enthalpy of lattice formation.
While a single covalent bond is formed by sharing of an electron pair between two atoms,
multiple bonds result from the sharing of two or three electron pairs. Some bonded atoms
have additional pairs of electrons not involved in bonding. These are called lone-pairs of
electrons. A Lewis dot structure shows the arrangement of bonded pairs and lone pairs around
each atom in a molecule. Important parameters, associated with chemical bonds, like:
bond length, bond angle, bond enthalpy, bond order and bond polarity have significant
effect on the properties of compounds.
A number of molecules and polyatomic ions cannot be described accurately by a single
Lewis structure and a number of descriptions (representations) based on the same skeletal
structure are written and these taken together represent the molecule or ion. This is a very
important and extremely useful concept called resonance. The contributing structures
or canonical forms taken together constitute the resonance hybrid which represents the
molecule or ion.

133

The VSEPR model used for predicting the geometrical shapes of molecules is based on
the assumption that electron pairs repel each other and, therefore, tend to remain as far
apart as possible. According to this model, molecular geometry is determined by repulsions
between lone pairs and lone pairs; lone pairs and bonding pairs and bonding pairs and bonding
pairs. The order of these repulsions being : lp-lp > lp-bp > bp-bp
The valence bond (VB) approach to covalent bonding is basically concerned with the
energetics of covalent bond formation about which the Lewis and VSEPR models are silent.
Basically the VB theory discusses bond formation  in terms of overlap of orbitals. For example
the formation of the H2 molecule from two hydrogen atoms involves the overlap of the 1s
orbitals of the two H atoms which are singly occupied. It is seen that the potential energy
of the system gets lowered as the two H atoms come near to each other. At the equilibrium
inter-nuclear distance (bond distance) the energy touches a minimum. Any attempt to bring
the nuclei still closer results in a sudden increase in energy and consequent destabilization
of the molecule. Because of orbital overlap the electron density between the nuclei increases
which helps in bringing them closer. It is however seen that the actual bond enthalpy and
bond length values are not obtained by overlap alone and other variables have to be taken
into account.
For explaining the characteristic shapes of polyatomic molecules Pauling introduced the
concept of hybridisation of atomic orbitals. sp, sp2, sp3 hybridizations of atomic orbitals
of Be, B, C, N and O are used to explain the formation and geometrical shapes of molecules
like BeCl2, BCl3, CH4, NH3 and H2O. They also explain the formation of multiple bonds in
molecules like C2H2 and C2H4.

The molecular orbital (MO) theory describes bonding in terms of the combination and
arrangment of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals that are associated with the molecule
as a whole. The number of molecular orbitals are always equal to the number of atomic
orbitals from which they are formed. Bonding molecular orbitals increase electron density
between the nuclei and are lower in energy than the individual atomic orbitals. Antibonding
molecular orbitals have a region of zero electron density between the nuclei and have more
energy than the individual atomic orbitals.
The electronic configuration of the molecules is written by filling electrons in the molecular
orbitals in the order of increasing energy levels. As in the case of atoms, the Pauli exclusion
principle and Hund’s rule are applicable for the filling of molecular orbitals. Molecules are
said to be stable if the number of elctrons in bonding molecular orbitals is greater than that
in antibonding molecular orbitals.
Hydrogen bond is formed when a hydrogen atom finds itself between two highly
electronegative atoms such as F, O and N. It may be intermolecular (existing between two
or more molecules of the same or different substances) or intramolecular (present within
the same molecule). Hydrogen bonds have a powerful effect on the structure and properties
of many compounds.

Albert Einstein

Chemical energy stored by molecules can be released as
heat during chemical reactions when a fuel like methane,
cooking gas or coal burns in air. The chemical energy may
also be used to do mechanical work when a fuel burns
in an engine or to provide electrical energy through a
galvanic cell like dry cell. Thus, various forms of energy
are interrelated and under certain conditions, these may
be transformed from one form into another. The study
of these energy transformations forms the subject matter
of thermodynamics. The laws of thermodynamics deal
with energy changes of macroscopic systems involving
a large number of molecules rather than microscopic
systems containing a few molecules. Thermodynamics is
not concerned about how and at what rate these energy
transformations are carried out, but is based on initial and
final states of a system undergoing the change. Laws of
thermodynamics apply only when a system is in equilibrium
or moves from one equilibrium state to another equilibrium
state. Macroscopic properties like pressure and temperature
do not change with time for a system in equilibrium state.
In this unit, we would like to answer some of the important
questions through thermodynamics, like:
How do we determine the energy changes involved in a
chemical reaction/process? Will it occur or not?
What drives a chemical reaction/process?
To what extent do the chemical reactions proceed?

THERMODYNAMICS								

5.1 Thermodynamic terms
We are interested in chemical reactions and
the energy changes accompanying them. For
this we need to know certain thermodynamic
terms. These are discussed below.
5.1.1 The System and the Surroundings
A system in thermodynamics refers to that
part of universe in which observations are
made and remaining universe constitutes
the surroundings. The surroundings include
everything other than the system. System
and the surroundings together constitute the
universe.
The universe = The system + The surroundings
However, the entire universe other than
the system is not affected by the changes
taking place in the system. Therefore, for all
practical purposes, the surroundings are that
portion of the remaining universe which can
interact with the system. Usually, the region
of space in the neighbourhood of the system
constitutes its surroundings.
For example, if we are studying the
reaction between two substances A and B
kept in a beaker, the beaker containing the
reaction mixture is the system and the room
where the beaker is kept is the surroundings
(Fig. 5.1).

137

the system from the surroundings is called
boundary. This is designed to allow us to
control and keep track of all movements of
matter and energy in or out of the system.
5.1.2 Types of the System
We, further classify the systems according
to the movements of matter and energy in or
out of the system.
1. Open System
In an open system, there is exchange of energy
and matter between system and surroundings
[Fig. 5.2 (a)]. The presence of reactants in an
open beaker is an example of an open system*.
Here the boundary is an imaginary surface
enclosing the beaker and reactants.
2. Closed System
In a closed system, there is no exchange of
matter, but exchange of energy is possible
between system and the surroundings
[Fig. 5.2 (b)]. The presence of reactants in a
closed vessel made of conducting material
e.g., copper or steel is an example of a closed
system.

Fig. 5.1 System and the surroundings

Note that the system may be defined
by physical boundaries, like beaker or test
tube, or the system may simply be defined
by a set of Cartesian coordinates specifying
a particular volume in space. It is necessary
to think of the system as separated from the
surroundings by some sort of wall which may
be real or imaginary. The wall that separates

Fig. 5.2

Open, closed and isolated systems.

* We could have chosen only the reactants as system then walls of the beakers will act as boundary.

chemIstry

3. Isolated System
In an isolated system, there is no exchange
of energy or matter between the system and
the surroundings [Fig. 5.2 (c)]. The presence
of reactants in a thermos flask or any other
closed insulated vessel is an example of an
isolated system.
5.1.3 The State of the System
The system must be described in order to
make any useful calculations by specifying
quantitatively each of the properties such as
its pressure (p), volume (V), and temperature
(T ) as well as the composition of the system.
We need to describe the system by specifying
it before and after the change. You would
recall from your Physics course that the
state of a system in mechanics is completely
specified at a given instant of time, by the
position and velocity of each mass point of
the system. In thermodynamics, a different
and much simpler concept of the state of a
system is introduced. It does not need detailed
knowledge of motion of each particle because,
we deal with average measurable properties of
the system. We specify the state of the system
by state functions or state variables.
The state of a thermodynamic system is
described by its measurable or macroscopic
(bulk) properties. We can describe the state
of a gas by quoting its pressure (p), volume
(V), temperature (T ), amount (n) etc. Variables
like p, V, T are called state variables or state
functions because their values depend only
on the state of the system and not on how it
is reached. In order to completely define the
state of a system it is not necessary to define
all the properties of the system; as only a
certain number of properties can be varied
independently. This number depends on the
nature of the system. Once these minimum
number of macroscopic properties are fixed,
others automatically have definite values.
The state of the surroundings can never
be completely specified; fortunately it is not
necessary to do so.
5.1.4 The Internal Energy as a State
Function
When we talk about our chemical system
losing or gaining energy, we need to introduce

a quantity which represents the total energy
of the system. It may be chemical, electrical,
mechanical or any other type of energy you
may think of, the sum of all these is the energy
of the system. In thermodynamics, we call it
the internal energy, U of the system, which
may change, when
• heat passes into or out of the system,
• work is done on or by the system,
• matter enters or leaves the system.
These systems are classified accordingly
as you have already studied in section 5.1.2.
(a) Work
Let us first examine a change in internal energy
by doing work. We take a system containing
some quantity of water in a thermos flask
or in an insulated beaker. This would not
allow exchange of heat between the system
and surroundings through its boundary and
we call this type of system as adiabatic. The
manner in which the state of such a system
may be changed will be called adiabatic
process. Adiabatic process is a process in
which there is no transfer of heat between
the system and surroundings. Here, the wall
separating the system and the surroundings
is called the adiabatic wall (Fig. 5.3).

Fig. 5.3

An adiabatic system which does not
permit the transfer of heat through its
boundary.

Let us bring the change in the internal
energy of the system by doing some work on
it. Let us call the initial state of the system
as state A and its temperature as TA. Let
the internal energy of the system in state A
be called UA. We can change the state of the
system in two different ways.



Unit 5.indd 138

9/12/2022 11:53:36 AM

THERMODYNAMICS								

One way: We do some mechanical work, say
1 kJ, by rotating a set of small paddles and
thereby churning water. Let the new state
be called B state and its temperature, as
TB. It is found that TB > TA and the change
in temperature, ∆T = TB–TA. Let the internal
energy of the system in state B be UB and the
change in internal energy, ∆U =UB– UA.
Second way: We now do an equal amount
(i.e., 1kJ) electrical work with the help of an
immersion rod and note down the temperature
change. We find that the change in temperature
is same as in the earlier case, say, TB – TA.
In fact, the experiments in the above
manner were done by J. P. Joule between
1840–50 and he was able to show that a
given amount of work done on the system,
no matter how it was done (irrespective of
path) produced the same change of state, as
measured by the change in the temperature
of the system.
So, it seems appropriate to define a
quantity, the internal energy U, whose value
is characteristic of the state of a system,
whereby the adiabatic work, wad required to
bring about a change of state is equal to the
difference between the value of U in one state
and that in another state, ∆U i.e.,
∆U =U2 –U1= wad
Therefore, internal energy, U, of the
system is a state function.
By conventions of IUPAC in chemical
thermodynamics. The positive sign expresses
that wad is positive when work is done on the
system and the internal energy of system
increases. Similarly, if the work is done by the
system, wad will be negative because internal
energy of the system decreases.
Can you name some other familiar state
functions? Some of other familiar state
functions are V, p, and T. For example, if we
bring a change in temperature of the system
from 25°C to 35°C, the change in temperature
is 35°C–25°C = +10°C, whether we go straight
up to 35°C or we cool the system for a few
degrees, then take the system to the final
temperature. Thus, T is a state function and
the change in temperature is independent of

139

the route taken. Volume of water in a pond, for
example, is a state function, because change
in volume of its water is independent of the
route by which water is filled in the pond,
either by rain or by tubewell or by both.
(b) Heat
We can also change the internal energy
of a system by transfer of heat from the
surroundings to the system or vice-versa
without expenditure of work. This exchange
of energy, which is a result of temperature
difference is called heat, q. Let us consider
bringing about the same change in temperature
(the same initial and final states as before
in section 5.1.4 (a) by transfer of heat
through thermally conducting walls instead
of adiabatic walls (Fig. 5.4).

Fig. 5.4

A system which allows heat transfer
through its boundary.

We take water at temperature, TA in a
container having thermally conducting walls,
say made up of copper and enclose it in a
huge heat reservoir at temperature, TB. The
heat absorbed by the system (water), q can be
measured in terms of temperature difference,
TB – TA. In this case change in internal energy,
∆U = q, when no work is done at constant
volume.
By conventions of IUPAC in chemical
thermodynamics. The q is positive, when heat
is transferred from the surroundings to the
system and the internal energy of the system
increases and q is negative when heat is
transferred from system to the surroundings
resulting in decrease of the internal energy of
the system.

* Earlier negative sign was assigned when the work is done on the system and positive sign when the work is done by the
system. This is still followed in physics books, although IUPAC has recommended the use of new sign convention.

(c) The general case
Let us consider the general case in which
a change of state is brought about both by
doing work and by transfer of heat. We write
change in internal energy for this case as:
(5.1)
∆U = q + w			
For a given change in state, q and w can
vary depending on how the change is carried
out. However, q +w = ∆U will depend only on
initial and final state. It will be independent
of the way the change is carried out. If there
is no transfer of energy as heat or as work
(isolated system) i.e., if w = 0 and q = 0, then
∆ U = 0.
The equation 5.1 i.e., ∆U = q + w is
mathematical statement of the first law of
thermodynamics, which states that
The energy of an isolated system is
constant.
It is commonly stated as the law of conservation
of energy i.e., energy can neither be created
nor be destroyed.
Note: There is considerable difference between
the character of the thermodynamic property
energy and that of a mechanical property such
as volume. We can specify an unambiguous
(absolute) value for volume of a system in a
particular state, but not the absolute value of
the internal energy. However, we can measure
only the changes in the internal energy, ∆U
of the system.

Solution
(i)		
∆ U = w ad, wall is adiabatic
(ii) ∆ U = – q, thermally conducting
walls
(iii) ∆ U = q – w, closed system.
5.2	Applications
Many chemical reactions involve the generation
of gases capable of doing mechanical work or
the generation of heat. It is important for us
to quantify these changes and relate them
to the changes in the internal energy. Let us
see how!
5.2.1 Work
First of all, let us concentrate on the nature of
work a system can do. We will consider only
mechanical work i.e., pressure-volume work.
For understanding pressure-volume
work, let us consider a cylinder which
contains one mole of an ideal gas fitted with
a frictionless piston. Total volume of the gas
is Vi and pressure of the gas inside is p. If
external pressure is pex which is greater than
p, piston is moved inward till the pressure

Problem 5.1
Express the change in internal energy
of a system when
(i) No heat is absorbed by the system
from the surroundings, but work
(w) is done on the system. What
type of wall does the system have ?
(ii) No work is done on the system,
but q amount of heat is taken out
from the system and given to the
surroundings. What type of wall
does the system have?
(iii) w amount of work is done by the
system and q amount of heat is
supplied to the system. What type
of system would it be?

Fig. 5.5 (a) Work done on an ideal gas in a
cylinder when it is compressed by
a constant external pressure, p ex

area.

inside becomes equal to pex. Let this change
be achieved in a single step and the final
volume be V f . During this compression,
suppose piston moves a distance, l and
is cross-sectional area of the piston is A
[Fig. 5.5(a)].
then, volume change = l × A = ∆V = (Vf – Vi )
We also know, pressure =
Therefore, force on the piston = pex . A
If w is the work done on the system by
movement of the piston then
w = force × distance = pex . A .l
(5.2)
= pex . (–∆V) = – pex ∆V = – pex (Vf – Vi )
The negative sign of this expression is
required to obtain conventional sign for w,
which will be positive. It indicates that in case
of compression work is done on the system.
Here (Vf – Vi ) will be negative and negative
multiplied by negative will be positive. Hence
the sign obtained for the work will be positive.
If the pressure is not constant at every
stage of compression, but changes in number
of finite steps, work done on the gas will be
summed over all the steps and will be equal
to – Σ р ∆V [Fig. 5.5 (b)]

Fig. 5.5 (b) pV-plot when pressure is not constant
and changes in finite steps during
compression from initial volume, Vi to
final volume, Vf . Work done on the gas
is represented by the shaded area.

141

If the pressure is not constant but
changes during the process such that it
is always infinitesimally greater than the
pressure of the gas, then, at each stage of
compression, the volume decreases by an
infinitesimal amount, dV. In such a case we
can calculate the work done on the gas by the
relation
Vf

w    pex dV

(5.3)

Vi

Here, pex at each stage is equal to (pin + dp)
in case of compression [Fig. 5.5(c)]. In an
expansion process under similar conditions,
the external pressure is always less than the
pressure of the system i.e., pex = (pin– dp). In
general case we can write, pex = (pin + dp). Such
processes are called reversible processes.
A process or change is said to be
reversible, if a change is brought out in such a
way that the process could, at any moment,
be reversed by an infinitesimal change.
A reversible process proceeds infinitely
slowly by a series of equilibrium states
such that system and the surroundings are
always in near equilibrium with each other.

and changes in infinite steps (reversible
conditions) during compression from
initial volume, Vi to final volume, Vf .
Work done on the gas is represented
by the shaded area.

Processes other than reversible processes
are known as irreversible processes.
In chemistry, we face problems that can
be solved if we relate the work term to the
internal pressure of the system. We can
relate work to internal pressure of the system
under reversible conditions by writing
equation 5.3 as follows:
Vf

Vf

Vi

Vi

w rev    pex dV    ( pin  dp ) dV
Since dp × dV is very small we can write

w rev    pin dV

(5.4)

Isothermal and free expansion of an
ideal gas
For isothermal (T = constant) expansion of
an ideal gas into vacuum; w = 0 since pex = 0.
Also, Joule determined experimentally that
q = 0; therefore, ∆U = 0
can be
Equation 5.1,
expressed for isothermal irreversible and
reversible changes as follows:
1. For isothermal irreversible change
q = – w = pex (Vf – Vi )
2. For isothermal reversible change
q = – w = nRT ln

Now, the pressure of the gas (pin which we
can write as p now) can be expressed in terms
of its volume through gas equation. For n mol

Two litres of an ideal gas at a pressure of 10
atm expands isothermally at 25 °C into a
vacuum until its total volume is 10 litres.
How much heat is absorbed and how
much work is done in the expansion ?
Solution

(5.5)

Free expansion: Expansion of a gas in
vacuum (pex = 0) is called free expansion.
No work is done during free expansion of an
ideal gas whether the process is reversible or
irreversible (equation 5.2 and 5.3).
Now, we can write equation 5.1 in number
of ways depending on the type of processes.
Let us substitute w = – pex∆V (eq. 5.2) in
equation 5.1, and we get
U  q  pex V
		
If a process is carried out at constant volume
(∆V = 0), then
∆U = qV
the subscript V in qV denotes that heat is
supplied at constant volume.

We have q = – w = pex (10 – 2) = 0(8) = 0
No work is done; no heat is absorbed.
Problem 5.3
Consider the same expansion, but
this time against a constant external
pressure of 1 atm.

We have q = – w = pex (8) = 8 litre-atm

5.2.2 Enthalpy, H
(a) A Useful New State Function
We know that the heat absorbed at constant
volume is equal to change in the internal
energy i.e., ∆U = qV. But most of chemical
reactions are carried out not at constant
volume, but in flasks or test tubes under
constant atmospheric pressure. We need to
define another state function which may be
suitable under these conditions.
We may write equation (5.1) as
∆U = qp – p∆V at constant pressure, where
qp is heat absorbed by the system and –p ∆V
represent expansion work done by the system.
Let us represent the initial state by
subscript 1 and final state by 2
We can rewrite the above equation as
U2–U1 = qp – p (V2 – V1)
On rearranging, we get
(5.6)
qp = (U2 + pV2) – (U1 + pV1)
Now we can define another thermodynamic
function, the enthalpy H [Greek word
enthalpien, to warm or heat content] as :
H = U + pV 		
(5.7)
so, equation (5.6) becomes
qp= H2 – H1 = ∆H
Although q is a path dependent function,
H is a state function because it depends on
U, p and V, all of which are state functions.
Therefore, ∆H is independent of path. Hence,
qp is also independent of path.
For finite changes at constant pressure,
we can write equation 5.7 as
∆H = ∆U + ∆pV
Since p is constant, we can write
∆H = ∆U + p∆V
(5.8)
It is important to note that when heat is
absorbed by the system at constant pressure,
we are actually measuring changes in the
enthalpy.

143

Remember ∆H = qp, heat absorbed by the
system at constant pressure.
∆H is negative for exothermic reactions
which evolve heat during the reaction and
∆H is positive for endothermic reactions
which absorb heat from the surroundings.
At constant volume (∆V = 0), ∆U = qV,
therefore equation 5.8 becomes
∆H = ∆U = qV
The difference between ∆H and ∆U is not
usually significant for systems consisting
of only solids and / or liquids. Solids and
liquids do not suffer any significant volume
changes upon heating. The difference,
however, becomes significant when gases are
involved. Let us consider a reaction involving
gases. If VA is the total volume of the gaseous
reactants, VB is the total volume of the gaseous
products, nA is the number of moles of gaseous
reactants and nB is the number of moles of
gaseous products, all at constant pressure
and temperature, then using the ideal gas
law, we write,
		

pVA = nART

and		

pVB = nBRT

Thus, pVB – pVA = nBRT – nART = (nB–nA)RT
or

p (VB – VA) = (nB – nA) RT

or

p ∆V = ∆ngRT

(5.9)

Here, ∆ng refers to the number of moles of
gaseous products minus the number of moles
of gaseous reactants.
Substituting the value of p∆V from
equation 5.9 in equation 5.8, we get
∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT
(5.10)
The equation 5.10 is useful for calculating
∆H from ∆U and vice versa.

perfect gas, molar enthalpy change for

values, we get
∆U = 41.00 kJ mol–1 – 1

= 41.00 kJ mol-1 – 3.096 kJ mol-1
Fig. 5.6 (b) Partition, each part having half the
volume of the gas

= 37.904 kJ mol–1
(b) Extensive and Intensive Properties
In thermodynamics, a distinction is made
between extensive properties and intensive
properties. An extensive property is a
property whose value depends on the quantity
or size of matter present in the system. For
example, mass, volume, internal energy,
enthalpy, heat capacity, etc. are extensive
properties.
Those properties which do not depend
on the quantity or size of matter present
are known as intensive properties. For
example temperature, density, pressure etc.
are intensive properties. A molar property,
χm, is the value of an extensive property χ of
the system for 1 mol of the substance. If n is

the amount of matter,  m  n is independent
of the amount of matter. Other examples are
molar volume, Vm and molar heat capacity,
C m . Let us understand the distinction
between extensive and intensive properties by
considering a gas enclosed in a container of
volume V and at temperature T [Fig. 5.6(a)].
Let us make a partition such that volume
is halved, each part [Fig. 5.6 (b)] now has
one half of the original volume, V , but the
2
temperature will still remain the same i.e., T.
It is clear that volume is an extensive property
and temperature is an intensive property.

(c) Heat Capacity
In this sub-section, let us see how to measure
heat transferred to a system. This heat
appears as a rise in temperature of the system
in case of heat absorbed by the system.
The increase of temperature is proportional
to the heat transferred

q  coeff  T
The magnitude of the coefficient depends
on the size, composition and nature of the
system. We can also write it as q = C ∆T
The coefficient, C is called the heat
capacity.
Thus, we can measure the heat supplied
by monitoring the temperature rise, provided
we know the heat capacity.
When C is large, a given amount of heat
results in only a small temperature rise. Water
has a large heat capacity i.e., a lot of energy
is needed to raise its temperature.
C is directly proportional to amount of
substance. The molar heat capacity of a
substance, Cm =  C  , is the heat capacity
n
for one mole of the substance and is
the quantity of heat needed to raise the
temperature of one mole by one degree
celsius (or one kelvin). Specific heat, also
called specific heat capacity is the quantity

of heat required to raise the temperature of
one unit mass of a substance by one degree
celsius (or one kelvin). For finding out the
heat, q, required to raise the temperatures
of a sample, we multiply the specific heat
of the substance, c, by the mass m, and
temperatures change, ∆T as

At constant volume, the heat capacity, C is
denoted by CV and at constant pressure, this
is denoted by Cp . Let us find the relationship
between the two.

For chemical reactions, heat absorbed at
constant volume, is measured in a bomb
calorimeter (Fig. 5.7). Here, a steel vessel (the
bomb) is immersed in a water bath. The whole
device is called calorimeter. The steel vessel is
immersed in water bath to ensure that no heat

5.3	Measurement of ∆U and ∆H:
Calorimetry
We can measure energy changes associated
with chemical or physical processes by an
experimental technique called calorimetry.
In calorimetry, the process is carried out in a
vessel called calorimeter, which is immersed
in a known volume of a liquid. Knowing
the heat capacity of the liquid in which
calorimeter is immersed and the heat capacity
of calorimeter, it is possible to determine the
heat evolved in the process by measuring
temperature changes. Measurements are
made under two different conditions:

substance is burnt in pure dioxygen supplied
in the steel bomb. Heat evolved during the
reaction is transferred to the water around the
bomb and its temperature is monitored. Since
the bomb calorimeter is sealed, its volume
does not change i.e., the energy changes
associated with reactions are measured at
constant volume. Under these conditions, no
work is done as the reaction is carried out
at constant volume in the bomb calorimeter.
Even for reactions involving gases, there is no
work done as ∆V = 0. Temperature change of
the calorimeter produced by the completed
reaction is then converted to qV, by using the
known heat capacity of the calorimeter with
the help of equation 5.11.

(b) ∆H Measurements
Measurement of heat change at constant
pressure (generally under atmospheric pressure)
can be done in a calorimeter shown in Fig. 5.8.
We know that ∆Η = qp (at constant p) and,
therefore, heat absorbed or evolved, qp at
constant pressure is also called the heat of
reaction or enthalpy of reaction, ∆rH.
In an exothermic reaction, heat is evolved,
and system loses heat to the surroundings.
Therefore, qp will be negative and ∆rH will
also be negative. Similarly in an endothermic
reaction, heat is absorbed, qp is positive and
∆rH will be positive.

of the bomb calorimeter is 20.7kJ/K,
what is the enthalpy change for the above
reaction at 298 K and 1 atm?
Solution
Suppose q is the quantity of heat from
the reaction mixture and C V is the
heat capacity of the calorimeter, then
the quantity of heat absorbed by the
calorimeter.
q = CV × ∆T
Quantity of heat from the reaction will
have the same magnitude but opposite
sign because the heat lost by the system
(reaction mixture) is equal to the heat
gained by the calorimeter.
q = –CV × ∆T = – 20.7 kJ/K × (299 – 298) K
= – 20.7 kJ
(Here, negative sign indicates the
exothermic nature of the reaction)
Thus, ∆U for the combustion of the 1g of
graphite = – 20.7 kJK–1
For combustion of 1 mol of graphite,

ethanol at 298 K is pure liquid ethanol at

at 298 K.
Standard conditions are denoted by

e.g., ∆H
(b) Enthalpy Changes
Transformations

during

Phase

Enthalpy change is a very useful quantity.
Knowledge of this quantity is required when
one needs to plan the heating or cooling
required to maintain an industrial chemical
reaction at constant temperature. It is also
required to calculate temperature dependence
of equilibrium constant.

Phase transformations also involve energy
changes. Ice, for example, requires heat for
melting. Normally this melting takes place at
constant pressure (atmospheric pressure) and
during phase change, temperature remains
constant (at 273 K).

(a) Standard Enthalpy of Reactions

H2O(s) → H2O(l); ∆fusH  = 6.00 kJ moI–1

Enthalpy of a reaction depends on the
conditions under which a reaction is carried
out. It is, therefore, necessary that we
must specify some standard conditions.
The standard enthalpy of reaction is the
enthalpy change for a reaction when all
the participating substances are in their
standard states.
The standard state of a substance at a
specified temperature is its pure form at
1 bar. For example, the standard state of liquid

Here ∆fusH is enthalpy of fusion in standard
state. If water freezes, then process is reversed
and equal amount of heat is given off to the
surroundings.
The enthalpy change that accompanies
melting of one mole of a solid substance in
standard state is called standard enthalpy
of fusion or molar enthalpy of fusion,
∆fusH .
Melting of a solid is endothermic, so
all enthalpies of fusion are positive. Water

requires heat for evaporation. At constant
temperature of its boiling point Tb and at
constant pressure:
H2O(l) → H2O(g); ∆vapH = + 40.79 kJ moI–1
∆vapH is the standard enthalpy of vaporisation.
Amount of heat required to vaporize one
mole of a liquid at constant temperature
and under standard pressure (1bar) is called
its standard enthalpy of vaporization or
molar enthalpy of vaporization, ∆vapH .
Sublimation is direct conversion of a
solid into its vapour. Solid CO2 or ‘dry ice’
sublimes at 195K with ∆subH=25.2 kJ mol–1;
naphthalene sublimes slowly and for this
∆sub H = 73.0 kJ mol–1 .
Standard enthalpy of sublimation,
∆subH is the change in enthalpy when one
mole of a solid substance sublimes at a
constant temperature and under standard
pressure (1bar).
The magnitude of the enthalpy change
depends on the strength of the intermolecular
interactions in the substance undergoing
the phase transfomations. For example,
the strong hydrogen bonds between water
molecules hold them tightly in liquid phase.
For an organic liquid, such as acetone, the
intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions are
significantly weaker. Thus, it requires less
heat to vaporise 1 mol of acetone than it does
to vaporize 1 mol of water. Table 5.1 gives
values of standard enthalpy changes of fusion
and vaporisation for some substances.

Problem 5.8
Assuming the water vapour to be a perfect
gas, calculate the internal energy change

pressure is converted to ice at 0°C. Given
the enthalpy of fusion of ice is 6.00 kJ
mol-1 heat capacity of water is 4.2 J/g°C

1 mol H2O (l, 100°C)  1

Step - 2

∆H1 = - (18 x 4.2 x 100) J mol-1
= - 7560 J mol-1 = - 7.56 k J mol-1
∆H2 = - 6.00 kJ mol-1

Selected Substances

Therefore,
∆H = - 7.56 kJ mol-1 + (-6.00 kJ mol-1)
   = -13.56 kJ mol-1
There is negligible change in the volume
during the change form liquid to solid
state.
Therefore, p∆v = ∆ng RT = 0
∆H = ∆U = - 13.56kJ mol-1
(c) Standard Enthalpy of Formation
The standard enthalpy change for the
formation of one mole of a compound from
its elements in their most stable states

of aggregation (also known as reference
states) is called Standard Molar Enthalpy
of Formation. Its symbol is ∆f H , where the
subscript ‘ f ’ indicates that one mole of the
compound in question has been formed in its
standard state from its elements in their most
stable states of aggregation. The reference
state of an element is its most stable state
of aggregation at 25°C and 1 bar pressure.
For example, the reference state of dihydrogen
is H 2 gas and those of dioxygen, carbon
and sulphur are O2 gas, Cgraphite and Srhombic
respectively. Some reactions with standard
molar enthalpies of formation are as follows.

H2(g) + ½O2 (g) → H2O(1);
∆f H = –285.8 kJ mol–1
C (graphite, s) + 2H2(g) → Ch4 (g);
∆f H = –74.81 kJ mol–1
2C (graphite, s)+3H2 (g)+ ½O2(g) → C2H5OH(1);
∆f H  = – 277.7kJ mol–1
It is important to understand that a
standard molar enthalpy of formation, ∆f H ,
is just a special case of ∆rH , where one mole
of a compound is formed from its constituent
elements, as in the above three equations,
where 1 mol of each, water, methane and
ethanol is formed. In contrast, the enthalpy
change for an exothermic reaction:
CaO(s) + CO2(g) → CaCo3(s);
∆rH  = – 178.3kJ mol–1
is not an enthalpy of formation of calcium
carbonate, since calcium carbonate has been
formed from other compounds, and not from
its constituent elements. Also, for the reaction
given below, enthalpy change is not standard
enthalpy of formation, ∆fH  for HBr(g).
H2(g) + Br2(l) → 2HBr(g);
∆r H  = – 178.3kJ mol–1

Here two moles, instead of one mole of the
product is formed from the elements, i.e.,
∆r H  = 2∆f H
Therefore, by dividing all coefficients in
the balanced equation by 2, expression for
enthalpy of formation of HBr (g) is written as
½H2(g) + ½Br2(1) → HBr(g);
∆f H = – 36.4 kJ mol–1
Standard enthalpies of formation of some
common substances are given in Table 5.2.
By convention, standard enthalpy for
formation, ∆f H , of an element in reference
state, i.e., its most stable state of aggregation
is taken as zero.
Suppose, you are a chemical engineer and
want to know how much heat is required to
decompose calcium carbonate to lime and
carbon dioxide, with all the substances in
their standard state.
CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g); ∆r H = ?

Here, we can make use of standard enthalpy
of formation and calculate the enthalpy
change for the reaction. The following general
equation can be used for the enthalpy change
calculation.
∆rH = ∑ ai ∆f H (products) – ∑ bi ∆f H (reactants)
i
i
(5.15)
where a and b represent the coefficients of
the products and reactants in the balanced
equation. Let us apply the above equation for
decomposition of calcium carbonate. Here,
coefficients ‘a’ and ‘b’ are 1 each. Therefore,
∆rH = ∆f H  = [CaO(s)]+ ∆f H  [CO2(g)]
– ∆f H  = [CaCO3(s)]
=1 (–635.1 kJ mol–1) + 1(–393.5 kJ mol–1)
–1(–1206.9 kJ mol–1)
–1
= 178.3 kJ mol
Thus, the decomposition of CaCO3 (s) is
an endothermic process and you have to heat
it for getting the desired products.
(d) Thermochemical Equations
A balanced chemical equation together with
the value of its ∆rH is called a thermochemical
equation. We specify the physical state
(alongwith allotropic state) of the substance
in an equation. For example:
C2H5OH(l) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(l);
∆rH = – 1367 kJ mol–1
The above equation describes the
combustion of liquid ethanol at constant
temperature and pressure. The negative sign
of enthalpy change indicates that this is an
exothermic reaction.
It would be necessary to remember the
following conventions regarding thermochemical equations.
1. The coefficients in a balanced thermochemical equation refer to the number of
moles (never molecules) of reactants and
products involved in the reaction.
2. The numerical value of ∆rH  refers to the
number of moles of substances specified
by an equation. Standard enthalpy change
∆rH will have units as kJ mol–1.

THERMODYNAMICS								

To illustrate the concept, let us consider
the calculation of heat of reaction for the
following reaction :

Fe2O3  s   3H2  g   2Fe  s   3H2O  l  ,

From the Table (5.2) of standard enthalpy of
formation (∆f H ), we find :
∆f H (H2O,l) = –285.83 kJ mol–1;
∆f H (Fe2O3,s) = – 824.2 kJ mol–1;
Also ∆f H (Fe, s) = 0 and
∆f H (H2, g) = 0 as per convention
Then,
∆f H1 = 3(–285.83 kJ mol–1)
– 1(– 824.2 kJ mol–1)
= (–857.5 + 824.2) kJ mol–1
= –33.3 kJ mol–1
Note that the coefficients used in these
calculations are pure numbers, which
are equal to the respective stoichiometric
c o e f f i c i e n t s . T h e u n i t f o r ∆ rH  i s

particular way, as above, this defines the mole
of reaction. If we had balanced the equation

(e) Hess’s
Law
of
Constant
Heat
Summation
We know that enthalpy is a state function,
therefore the change in enthalpy is independent
of the path between initial state (reactants)
and final state (products). In other words,
enthalpy change for a reaction is the same
whether it occurs in one step or in a series
of steps. This may be stated as follows in the
form of Hess’s Law.
If a reaction takes place in several
steps then its standard reaction enthalpy
is the sum of the standard enthalpies of
the intermediate reactions into which the
overall reaction may be divided at the same
temperature.
Let us understand the importance of this
law with the help of an example.
Consider the enthalpy change for the
reaction
C (graphite,s) + O2 (g) → CO (g); ∆r H  = ?
Although CO(g) is the major product, some
CO2 gas is always produced in this reaction.
Therefore, we cannot measure enthalpy
change for the above reaction directly.
However, if we can find some other reactions
involving related species, it is possible to
calculate the enthalpy change for the above
reaction.
Let us consider the following reactions:
C (graphite,s) + O2 (g) → CO2 (g);
∆r H  = – 393.5 kJ mol–1 (i)

= (– 428.7 + 412.1) kJ mol–1
= –16.6 kJ mol–1 = ½ ∆r H 1
It shows that enthalpy is an extensive
quantity.
3. When a chemical equation is reversed,
the value of ∆rH  is reversed in sign. For
example
N2(g) + 3H2 (g) → 2NH3 (g);
∆r H  = – 91.8 kJ. mol–1
2NH3(g) → N2(g) + 3H2 (g);
∆r H  = + 91.8 kJ mol–1

CO (g) +

O (g) → CO2 (g)
2 2
∆ H  = – 283.0 kJ mol–1 (ii)
r

We can combine the above two reactions
in such a way so as to obtain the desired
reaction. To get one mole of CO(g) on the
right, we reverse equation (ii). In this, heat
is absorbed instead of being released, so we
change sign of ∆rH  value
CO2 (g) → CO (g) +

O2 (g);

∆r H  = + 283.0 kJ mol–1 (iii)

∆C H  = – 2802.0 kJ mol–1

for which ∆r H  = (– 393.5 + 283.0)
= – 110.5 kJ mol–1
In general, if enthalpy of an overall
reaction A→B along one route is ∆rH and
∆rH1, ∆rH2, ∆rH3..... representing enthalpies
of reactions leading to same product, B along
another route, then we have
∆rH = ∆rH1 + ∆rH2 + ∆rH3 ...

5.5	Enthalpies for different types

It is convenient to give name to enthalpies
specifying the types of reactions.

Similarly, combustion of glucose gives out
2802.0 kJ/mol of heat, for which the overall
equation is :

Standard Enthalpy of Combustion
(symbol : ∆cH )

Combustion reactions are exothermic in
nature. These are important in industry,
rocketry, and other walks of life. Standard
enthalpy of combustion is defined as the
enthalpy change per mole (or per unit amount)
of a substance, when it undergoes combustion
and all the reactants and products being
in their standard states at the specified
temperature.
Cooking gas in cylinders contains mostly
butane (C4H10). During complete combustion
of one mole of butane, 2658 kJ of heat is
released. We can write the thermochemical
reactions for this as:
13
C4 H10 ( g ) 
O2 ( g )  4CO2 ( g )  5H2O(1);
2
∆C H  = – 2658.0 kJ mol–1

Our body also generates energy from food
by the same overall process as combustion,
although the final products are produced after
a series of complex bio-chemical reactions
involving enzymes.
Problem 5.9

takes place at 298 K and 1 atm. After
combustion, CO2(g) and H2O (1) are

enthalpy of formation, ∆f H  of benzene.

∆f H  = – 48.51 kJ mol–1... (iv)
(b) Enthalpy of Atomization
(symbol: ∆aH )
Consider the following example of atomization
of dihydrogen
H2(g) → 2H(g); ∆aH  = 435.0 kJ mol–1
You can see that H atoms are formed by
breaking H–H bonds in dihydrogen. The
enthalpy change in this process is known
as enthalpy of atomization, ∆aH . It is the
enthalpy change on breaking one mole of
bonds completely to obtain atoms in the gas
phase.
In case of diatomic molecules, like
dihydrogen (given above), the enthalpy of
atomization is also the bond dissociation
enthalpy. The other examples of enthalpy of
atomization can be
CH4(g) → C(g) + 4H(g); ∆aH = 1665 kJ mol

Chemical reactions involve the breaking and
making of chemical bonds. Energy is required
to break a bond and energy is released when a
bond is formed. It is possible to relate heat of
reaction to changes in energy associated with
breaking and making of chemical bonds. With
reference to the enthalpy changes associated
with chemical bonds, two different terms are
used in thermodynamics.
(i)

Bond dissociation enthalpy

Mean bond enthalpy
Let us discuss these terms with reference
to diatomic and polyatomic molecules.
Diatomic Molecules: Consider the following
process in which the bonds in one mole of
dihydrogen gas (H2) are broken:
H2(g) → 2H(g); ∆H–HH  = 435.0 kJ mol–1
The enthalpy change involved in this process
is the bond dissociation enthalpy of H–H
bond. The bond dissociation enthalpy is the
change in enthalpy when one mole of covalent
bonds of a gaseous covalent compound is
broken to form products in the gas phase.
Note that it is the same as the enthalpy of
atomization of dihydrogen. This is true for all
diatomic molecules. For example:
Cl2(g) → 2Cl(g); ∆Cl–ClH  = 242 kJ mol–1

O2(g) → 2O(g); ∆O=OH = 428 kJ mol–1
In the case of polyatomic molecules, bond
dissociation enthalpy is different for different
bonds within the same molecule.
Polyatomic Molecules: Let us now consider
a polyatomic molecule like methane, CH4.
The overall thermochemical equation for its
atomization reaction is given below:

CH4 (g) → C(g) + 4H(g);

Note that the products are only atoms of C
and H in gaseous phase. Now see the following

∆a H  = 1665 kJ mol–1
In methane, all the four C – H bonds are
identical in bond length and energy. However,
the energies required to break the individual
C – H bonds in each successive step differ :

CH4(g) → CH3(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +427 kJ mol–1
CH3(g) → CH2(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +439 kJ mol–1
CH2(g) → CH(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +452 kJ mol–1
CH(g) → C(g)+H(g);∆bond H = +347 kJ mol–1
Therefore,
CH4(g) → C(g)+4H(g);∆a H = 1665 kJ mol–1
In such cases we use mean bond enthalpy
of C – H bond.
For example in CH4, ∆C–HH  is calculated as:
∆C–HH = ¼ (∆a H) = ¼ (1665 kJ mol–1)
= 416 kJ mol–1
We find that mean C–H bond enthalpy
in methane is 416 kJ/mol. It has been
found that mean C–H bond enthalpies differ
slightly from compound to compound, as
in CH3CH2Cl, CH3NO2, etc., but it does not
differ in a great deal*. Using Hess’s law, bond
enthalpies can be calculated. Bond enthalpy
values of some single and multiple bonds are

given in Table 5.3. The reaction enthalpies are
very important quantities as these arise from
the changes that accompany the breaking of
old bonds and formation of the new bonds.
We can predict enthalpy of a reaction in gas
phase, if we know different bond enthalpies.
The standard enthalpy of reaction, ∆rH is
related to bond enthalpies of the reactants
and products in gas phase reactions as:
∆r H   bond enthalpiesreactants

  bond enthalpies products

(5.17)**
This relationship is particularly more
useful when the required values of ∆f H are
not available. The net enthalpy change of a
reaction is the amount of energy required
to break all the bonds in the reactant
molecules minus the amount of energy
required to break all the bonds in the product
molecules. Remember that this relationship is
approximate and is valid when all substances

(reactants and products) in the reaction are
in gaseous state.
(d) Lattice Enthalpy
The lattice enthalpy of an ionic compound is
the enthalpy change which occurs when one
mole of an ionic compound dissociates into
its ions in gaseous state.

∆latticeH  = +788 kJ mol–1

Since it is impossible to determine lattice
enthalpies directly by experiment, we use
an indirect method where we construct an
enthalpy diagram called a Born-Haber Cycle
(Fig. 5.9).
Let us now calculate the lattice enthalpy
of Na+Cl–(s) by following steps given below :

enthalpy, ∆egH  = – 348.6 kJ mol–1.
You have learnt about ionization enthalpy
and electron gain enthalpy in Unit 3.
In fact, these terms have been taken
from thermodynamics. Earlier terms,
ionization energy and electron affinity
were in practice in place of the above
terms (see the box for justification).

Ionization Energy and Electron Affinity
Ionization energy and electron affinity
are defined at absolute zero. At any other
temperature, heat capacities for the reactants
and the products have to be taken into
account. Enthalpies of reactions for

So, ∆rCp = + 5/2 R (for ionization)

Therefore,
∆rH  (ionization enthalpy)

cycle. The importance of the cycle is that,
the sum of the enthalpy changes round a
cycle is zero. Applying Hess’s law, we get,

The enthalpy of solution of AB(s), ∆solH ,
in water is, therefore, determined by the
selective values of the lattice enthalpy, ∆latticeH

∆latticeH = 411.2 + 108.4 + 121 + 496 – 348.6

and enthalpy of hydration of ions, ∆hydH as
∆sol H  = ∆latticeH  + ∆hydH 
For most of the ionic compounds, ∆sol
H is positive and the dissociation process
is endothermic. Therefore the solubility of
most salts in water increases with rise of
temperature. If the lattice enthalpy is very
high, the dissolution of the compound may
not take place at all. Why do many fluorides
tend to be less soluble than the corresponding
chlorides? Estimates of the magnitudes of
enthalpy changes may be made by using
tables of bond energies (enthalpies) and lattice
energies (enthalpies).
(f) Enthalpy of Dilution

∆latticeH = + 788kJ
for NaCl(s)  Na+(g) + Cl–(g)
Internal energy is smaller by 2RT (because ∆ng
= 2) and is equal to + 783 kJ mol–1.
Now we use the value of lattice enthalpy
to calculate enthalpy of solution from the
expression:
∆solH = ∆latticeH + ∆hydH
For one mole of NaCl(s),
lattice enthalpy = + 788 kJ mol–1
and ∆hydH  = – 784 kJ mol–1( from the 		
literature)
∆sol H = + 788 kJ mol–1 – 784 kJ mol–1
= + 4 kJ mol–1
The dissolution of NaCl(s) is accompanied
by very little heat change.
(e) Enthalpy of Solution (symbol : ∆solH )
Enthalpy of solution of a substance is the
enthalpy change when one mole of it dissolves
in a specified amount of solvent. The enthalpy
of solution at infinite dilution is the enthalpy
change observed on dissolving the substance
in an infinite amount of solvent when the
interactions between the ions (or solute
molecules) are negligible.
When an ionic compound dissolves in a
solvent, the ions leave their ordered positions
on the crystal lattice. These are now more free in
solution. But solvation of these ions (hydration
in case solvent is water) also occurs at the
same time. This is shown diagrammatically,
for an ionic compound, AB (s)

It is known that enthalpy of solution is the
enthalpy change associated with the addition
of a specified amount of solute to the specified
amount of solvent at a constant temperature
and pressure. This argument can be applied
to any solvent with slight modification.
Enthalpy change for dissolving one mole of
gaseous hydrogen chloride in 10 mol of water
can be represented by the following equation.
For convenience we will use the symbol aq.
for water
HCl(g) + 10 aq. → HCl.10 aq.
∆H = –69.01 kJ / mol
Let us consider the following set of
enthalpy changes:
(S-1) HCl(g) + 25 aq. → HCl.25 aq.
∆H = –72.03 kJ / mol
(S-2) HCl(g) + 40 aq. → HCl.40 aq.
∆H = –72.79 kJ / mol
(S-3) HCl(g) + ∞ aq. → HCl. ∞ aq.
∆H = –74.85 kJ / mol
The values of ∆H show general dependence
of the enthalpy of solution on amount of
solvent. As more and more solvent is used,
the enthalpy of solution approaches a limiting
value, i.e, the value in infinitely dilute
solution. For hydrochloric acid this value of
∆H is given above in equation (S-3).



Unit 5.indd 156

9/12/2022 11:53:43 AM

THERMODYNAMICS								

If we subtract the first equation (equation
S-1) from the second equation (equation S-2)
in the above set of equations, we obtain–
HCl.25 aq. + 15 aq. → HCl.40 aq.
∆H = [ –72.79 – (–72.03)] kJ / mol
= – 0.76 kJ / mol
This value (–0.76kJ/mol) of ∆H is enthalpy
of dilution. It is the heat withdrawn from
the surroundings when additional solvent is
added to the solution. The enthalpy of dilution
of a solution is dependent on the original
concentration of the solution and the amount
of solvent added.
5.6 spontaneity
The first law of thermodynamics tells us
about the relationship between the heat
absorbed and the work performed on or
by a system. It puts no restrictions on
the direction of heat flow. However, the
flow of heat is unidirectional from higher
temperature to lower temperature. In fact,
all naturally occurring processes whether
chemical or physical will tend to proceed
spontaneously in one direction only. For
example, a gas expanding to fill the available
volume, burning carbon in dioxygen giving
carbon dioxide.
But heat will not flow from colder body to
warmer body on its own, the gas in a container
will not spontaneously contract into one
corner or carbon dioxide will not form carbon
and dioxygen spontaneously. These and many
other spontaneously occurring changes show
unidirectional change. We may ask ‘what is
the driving force of spontaneously occurring
changes ? What determines the direction of a
spontaneous change ? In this section, we shall
establish some criterion for these processes
whether these will take place or not.
Let us first understand what do we mean
by spontaneous reaction or change ? You
may think by your common observation that
spontaneous reaction is one which occurs
immediately when contact is made between
the reactants. Take the case of combination
of hydrogen and oxygen. These gases may
be mixed at room temperature and left for

157

many years without observing any perceptible
change. Although the reaction is taking place
between them, it is at an extremely slow
rate. It is still called spontaneous reaction.
So spontaneity means ‘having the potential
to proceed without the assistance of external
agency’. However, it does not tell about the
rate of the reaction or process. Another aspect
of spontaneous reaction or process, as we see
is that these cannot reverse their direction on
their own. We may summarise it as follows:
A spontaneous process is an
irreversible process and may only be
reversed by some external agency.
(a) Is Decrease in Enthalpy a Criterion
for Spontaneity ?
If we examine the phenomenon like flow of
water down hill or fall of a stone on to the
ground, we find that there is a net decrease
in potential energy in the direction of change.
By analogy, we may be tempted to state that
a chemical reaction is spontaneous in a
given direction, because decrease in energy
has taken place, as in the case of exothermic
reactions. For example:
1
N (g) + H2(g) = NH3(g);
2 2
∆r H  = – 46.1 kJ mol–1
1
1
H (g) + Cl2(g) = HCl (g);
2 2
2
∆r H  = – 92.32 kJ mol–1
1
H2(g) +
O2(g) → H2O(l) ;
2
∆ H  = –285.8 kJ mol–1
r

The decrease in enthalpy in passing from
reactants to products may be shown for any
exothermic reaction on an enthalpy diagram
as shown in Fig. 5.10(a).
Thus, the postulate that driving force for
a chemical reaction may be due to decrease
in energy sounds ‘reasonable’ as the basis of
evidence so far !
Now let us examine the following reactions:
1
N2(g) + O2(g) → NO2(g);
2
∆r H = +33.2 kJ mol–1

C(graphite, s) + 2 S(l) → CS2(l);
∆r H = +128.5 kJ mol–1

These reactions though endothermic, are
spontaneous. The increase in enthalpy may
be represented on an enthalpy diagram as
shown in Fig. 5.10(b).

Enthalpy diagram for endothermic
reactions

Therefore, it becomes obvious that while
decrease in enthalpy may be a contributory
factor for spontaneity, but it is not true for
all cases.
(b) Entropy and Spontaneity
Then, what drives the spontaneous process
in a given direction ? Let us examine such a
case in which ∆H = 0 i.e., there is no change in
enthalpy, but still the process is spontaneous.
Let us consider diffusion of two gases
into each other in a closed container which
is isolated from the surroundings as shown
in Fig. 5.11.
The two gases, say, gas A and gas B are
represented by black dots and white dots

respectively and separated by a movable
partition [Fig. 5.11 (a)]. When the partition is
withdrawn [Fig. 5.11(b)], the gases begin to
diffuse into each other and after a period of
time, diffusion will be complete.
Let us examine the process. Before
partition, if we were to pick up the gas
molecules from left container, we would be
sure that these will be molecules of gas A
and similarly if we were to pick up the gas
molecules from right container, we would
be sure that these will be molecules of gas
B. But, if we were to pick up molecules from
container when partition is removed, we are
not sure whether the molecules picked are of
gas A or gas B. We say that the system has
become less predictable or more chaotic.
We may now formulate another postulate:
in an isolated system, there is always a
tendency for the systems’ energy to become
more disordered or chaotic and this could be
a criterion for spontaneous change !
At this point, we introduce another
thermodynamic function, entropy denoted
as S. The above mentioned disorder is the
manifestation of entropy. To form a mental

THERMODYNAMICS								

picture, one can think of entropy as a measure
of the degree of randomness or disorder in the
system. The greater the disorder in an isolated
system, the higher is the entropy. As far as a
chemical reaction is concerned, this entropy
change can be attributed to rearrangement of
atoms or ions from one pattern in the reactants
to another (in the products). If the structure
of the products is very much disordered than
that of the reactants, there will be a resultant
increase in entropy. The change in entropy
accompanying a chemical reaction may be
estimated qualitatively by a consideration of
the structures of the species taking part in the
reaction. Decrease of regularity in structure
would mean increase in entropy. For a given
substance, the crystalline solid state is the
state of lowest entropy (most ordered), The
gaseous state is state of highest entropy.
Now let us try to quantify entropy. One way
to calculate the degree of disorder or chaotic
distribution of energy among molecules
would be through statistical method which
is beyond the scope of this treatment. Other
way would be to relate this process to the
heat involved in a process which would make
entropy a thermodynamic concept. Entropy,
like any other thermodynamic property such
as internal energy U and enthalpy H is a state
function and ∆S is independent of path.
Whenever heat is added to the system,
it increases molecular motions causing
increased randomness in the system. Thus
heat (q) has randomising influence on the
system. Can we then equate ∆S with q ? Wait !
Experience suggests us that the distribution
of heat also depends on the temperature at
which heat is added to the system. A system at
higher temperature has greater randomness
in it  than one at lower temperature. Thus,
temperature is the measure of average
chaotic motion of particles in the system.
Heat added to a system at lower temperature
causes greater randomness than when the
same quantity of heat is added to it at higher
temperature. This suggests that the entropy
change is inversely proportional to the
temperature. ∆S is related with q and T for a
reversible reaction as :

∆S =

qrev
T

159

(5.18)

The total entropy change (∆Stotal) for the
system and surroundings of a spontaneous
process is given by

Stotal  Ssystem  Ssurr  0

(5.19)

When a system is in equilibrium, the
entropy is maximum, and the change in
entropy, ∆S = 0.
We can say that entropy for a spontaneous
process increases till it reaches maximum
and at equilibrium the change in entropy is
zero. Since entropy is a state property, we can
calculate the change in entropy of a reversible
process by
∆Ssys =

qsys ,rev

T
We find that both for reversible and
irreversible expansion for an ideal gas, under
isothermal conditions, ∆U = 0,  but ∆S total
i.e., Ssys  Ssurr is not zero for irreversible
process. Thus,  ∆U does not discriminate
between reversible and irreversible process,
whereas ∆S does.

about their equilibrium positions
in the lattice and system becomes

increases.
(iii) Reactant, NaHCO3 is a solid and it
has low entropy. Among products
there are one solid and two gases.
Therefore, the products represent a

= 4980.6 JK–1 mol–1
This shows that the above reaction is
spontaneous.
(c) Gibbs Energy and Spontaneity
We have seen that for a system, it is the
total entropy change, ∆Stotal which decides
the spontaneity of the process. But most of
the chemical reactions fall into the category
of either closed systems or open systems.
Therefore, for most of the chemical reactions
there are changes in both enthalpy and
entropy. It is clear from the discussion in
previous sections that neither decrease in
enthalpy nor increase in entropy alone can
determine the direction of spontaneous
change for these systems.
For this purpose, we define a new
thermodynamic function the Gibbs energy
or Gibbs function, G, as
G = H – TS

(5.20)

Gibbs function, G is an extensive property
and a state function.
The change in Gibbs energy for the
system, ∆Gsys can be written as
Gsys = H sys  T Ssys  Ssys T

At constant temperature,
 Gsys = H sys  T Ssys

Usually the subscript ‘system’ is dropped
and we simply write this equation as
(5.21)
Thus, Gibbs energy change = enthalpy
change – temperature × entropy change, and
is referred to as the Gibbs equation, one of
the most important equations in chemistry.
Here, we have considered both terms together
for spontaneity: energy (in terms of ∆H)
and entropy (∆S, a measure of disorder) as
indicated earlier. Dimensionally if we analyse,
we find that ∆G has units of energy because,
both ∆H and the T∆S are energy terms, since
T∆S = (K) (J/K) = J.
G  H  T S

Now let us consider how ∆G is related to
reaction spontaneity.



Unit 5.indd 160

9/12/2022 11:53:48 AM

THERMODYNAMICS								

We know,
∆Stotal = ∆Ssys + ∆Ssurr
If the system is in thermal equilibrium with
the surrounding, then the temperature of the
surrounding is same as that of the system.
Also, increase in enthalpy of the surrounding
is equal to decrease in the enthalpy of the
system.
Therefore, entropy change of surroundings,

Rearranging the above equation:

For spontaneous process, Stotal  0 , so
T∆Ssys – ∆Hsys > Ο





  H sys  T Ssys  0
Using equation 5.21, the above equation can
be written as
–∆G > O
G  H  T S  0

(5.22)
∆Hsys is the enthalpy change of a reaction,
T∆Ssys is the energy which is not available to do
useful work. So ∆G is the net energy available
to do useful work and is thus a measure of the
‘free energy’. For this reason, it is also known
as the free energy of the reaction.

∆G gives a criteria for spontaneity at
constant pressure and temperature.
(i) If ∆G is negative (< 0), the process is
spontaneous.
(ii) If ∆G is positive (> 0), the process is non
spontaneous.
Note : If a reaction has a positive enthalpy
change and positive entropy change, it can
be spontaneous when T∆S is large enough to
outweigh ∆H. This can happen in two ways;
(a) The positive entropy change of the system
can be ‘small’ in which case T must be
large. (b) The positive entropy change of the
system can be ‘large’, in which case T may

161

be small. The former is one of the reasons
why reactions are often carried out at high
temperature. Table 5.4 summarises the effect
of temperature on spontaneity of reactions.
(d) Entropy and Second Law of
Thermodynamics
We know that for an isolated system
the change in energy remains constant.
Therefore, increase in entropy in such
systems is the natural direction of a
spontaneous change. This, in fact is the
second law of thermodynamics. Like first
law of thermodynamics, second law can also
be stated in several ways. The second law of
thermodynamics explains why spontaneous
exothermic reactions are so common.
In exothermic reactions heat released
by the reaction increases the disorder
of the surroundings and overall entropy
change is positive which makes the reaction
spontaneous.
(e) Absolute Entropy and Third Law of
Thermodynamics
Molecules of a substance may move in a
straight line in any direction, they may
spin like a top and the bonds in the
molecules may stretch and compress.
These motions of the molecule are called
translational, rotational and vibrational
motion respectively. When temperature of
the system rises, these motions become
more vigorous and entropy increases. On the
other hand when temperature is lowered, the
entropy decreases. The entropy of any pure
crystalline substance approaches zero as
the temperature approaches absolute zero.
This is called third law of thermodynamics.
This is so because there is perfect order in
a crystal at absolute zero. The statement is
confined to pure crystalline solids because
theoretical arguments and practical evidences
have shown that entropy of solutions and
super cooled liquids is not zero at 0 K. The
importance of the third law lies in the fact that
it permits the calculation of absolute values
of entropy of pure substance from thermal
data alone. For a pure substance, this can

equilibrium
We have seen how a knowledge of the sign
and magnitude of the free energy change of a
chemical reaction allows:
(i) Prediction of the spontaneity of the
chemical reaction.
(ii) Prediction of the useful work that could
be extracted from it.
So far we have considered free energy
changes in irreversible reactions. Let us now
examine the free energy changes in reversible
reactions.
‘Reversible’ under strict thermodynamic
sense is a special way of carrying out
a process such that system is at all
times in perfect equilibrium with its
surroundings. When applied to a chemical
reaction, the term ‘reversible’ indicates
that a given reaction can proceed in either
direction simultaneously, so that a dynamic
equilibrium is set up. This means that the
reactions in both the directions should
proceed with a decrease in free energy, which
seems impossible. It is possible only if at
equilibrium the free energy of the system

is minimum. If it is not, the system would
spontaneously change to configuration of
lower free energy.
So, the criterion for equilibrium
A + B  C + D; is
∆rG = 0
Gibbs energy for a reaction in which all
reactants and products are in standard state,
∆rG  is related to the equilibrium constant of
the reaction as follows:
0 = ∆rG  + RT ln K

or
or

∆rG  = – RT ln K

∆rG  = – 2.303 RT log K

(5.23)

We also know that
(5.24)
For strongly endothermic reactions, the
value of ∆rH may be large and positive. In
such a case, value of K will be much smaller
than 1 and the reaction is unlikely to
form much product. In case of exothermic
reactions, ∆rH is large and negative, and ∆rG
is likely to be large and negative too. In such
cases, K will be much larger than 1. We may
expect strongly exothermic reactions to have a
large K, and hence can go to near completion.
∆rG also depends upon ∆rS, if the changes
in the entropy of reaction is also taken into
account, the value of K or extent of chemical
reaction will also be affected, depending upon
whether ∆rS is positive or negative.

Summary
Thermodynamics deals with energy changes in chemical or physical processes and enables us to
study these changes quantitatively and to make useful predictions. For these purposes, we divide
the universe into the system and the surroundings. Chemical or physical processes lead to evolution
or absorption of heat (q), part of which may be converted into work (w). These quantities are related
through the first law of thermodynamics via ∆U = q + w. ∆U, change in internal energy, depends
on initial and final states only and is a state function, whereas q and w depend on the path and
are not the state functions. We follow sign conventions of q and w by giving the positive sign to
these quantities when these are added to the system. We can measure the transfer of heat from one
system to another which causes the change in temperature. The magnitude of rise in temperature
depends on the heat capacity (C) of a substance. Therefore, heat absorbed or evolved is q = C∆T.
Work can be measured by w = –pex∆V, in case of expansion of gases. Under reversible process, we
can put pex = p for infinitesimal changes in the volume making wrev = – p dV. In this condition, we
can use gas equation, pV = nRT.
At constant volume, w = 0, then ∆U = qV , heat transfer at constant volume. But in study of
chemical reactions, we usually have constant pressure. We define another state function enthalpy.
Enthalpy change, ∆H = ∆U + ∆ngRT, can be found directly from the heat changes at constant pressure,
∆H = qp.
There are varieties of enthalpy changes. Changes of phase such as melting, vaporization and
sublimation usually occur at constant temperature and can be characterized by enthalpy changes
which are always positive. Enthalpy of formation, combustion and other enthalpy changes can be
calculated using Hess’s law. Enthalpy change for chemical reactions can be determined by

and in gaseous state by
∆rH =

Σ bond enthalpies of the reactants – Σ bond enthalpies of the products

First law of thermodynamics does not guide us about the direction of chemical
reactions i.e., what is the driving force of a chemical reaction. For isolated systems,
∆U = 0. We define another state function, S, entropy for this purpose. Entropy is a measure
of disorder or randomness. For a spontaneous change, total entropy change is positive.
Therefore, for an isolated system, ∆U = 0, ∆S > 0, so entropy change distinguishes a spontaneous
change, while energy change does not. Entropy changes can be measured by the equation

for a reversible process.
T

Chemical reactions are generally carried at constant pressure, so we define another state function
Gibbs energy, G, which is related to entropy and enthalpy changes of the system by the equation:
∆rG = ∆rH – T ∆rS

For a spontaneous change, ∆Gsys < 0 and at equilibrium, ∆Gsys = 0.
Standard Gibbs energy change is related to equilibrium constant by
∆rG = – RT ln K.

K can be calculated from this equation, if we know ∆ rG  which can be found from
. Temperature is an important factor in the equation. Many reactions which
are non-spontaneous at low temperature, are made spontaneous at high temperature for systems
having positive entropy of reaction.

Chemical equilibria are important in numerous biological
and environmental processes. For example, equilibria
involving O2 molecules and the protein hemoglobin play
a crucial role in the transport and delivery of O2 from
our lungs to our muscles. Similar equilibria involving CO
molecules and hemoglobin account for the toxicity of CO.
When a liquid evaporates in a closed container,
molecules with relatively higher kinetic energy escape
the liquid surface into the vapour phase and number of
liquid molecules from the vapour phase strike the liquid
surface and are retained in the liquid phase. It gives rise
to a constant vapour pressure because of an equilibrium in
which the number of molecules leaving the liquid equals the
number returning to liquid from the vapour. We say that
the system has reached equilibrium state at this stage.
However, this is not static equilibrium and there is a lot of
activity at the boundary between the liquid and the vapour.
Thus, at equilibrium, the rate of evaporation is equal to the
rate of condensation. It may be represented by
H2O (l)

H2O (vap)

The double half arrows indicate that the processes
in both the directions are going on simultaneously. The
mixture of reactants and products in the equilibrium state
is called an equilibrium mixture.
Equilibrium can be established for both physical
processes and chemical reactions. The reaction may be
fast or slow depending on the experimental conditions and
the nature of the reactants. When the reactants in a closed
vessel at a particular temperature react to give products,
the concentrations of the reactants keep on decreasing,
while those of products keep on increasing for some time
after which there is no change in the concentrations
of either of the reactants or products. This stage of the
system is the dynamic equilibrium and the rates of the
forward and reverse reactions become equal. It is due to

EQUILIBRIUM

169

this dynamic equilibrium stage that there is
no change in the concentrations of various
species in the reaction mixture. Based on the
extent to which the reactions proceed to reach
the state of chemical equilibrium, these may
be classified in three groups.
(i)
The reactions that proceed nearly
to completion and only negligible
concentrations of the reactants are
left. In some cases, it may not be even
possible to detect these experimentally.
(ii) The reactions in which only small
amounts of products are formed and
most of the reactants remain unchanged
at equilibrium stage.
(iii) The reactions in which the concentrations
of the reactants and products are
comparable, when the system is in
equilibrium.
The extent of a reaction in equilibrium
varies with the experimental conditions such
as concentrations of reactants, temperature,
etc. Optimisation of the operational conditions
is very important in industry and laboratory
so that equilibrium is favorable in the
direction of the desired product. Some
important aspects of equilibrium involving
physical and chemical processes are dealt in
this unit along with the equilibrium involving
ions in aqueous solutions which is called as
ionic equilibrium.

PROCESSES
The characteristics of system at equilibrium
are better understood if we examine some
physical processes. The most familiar examples
are phase transformation processes, e.g.,
solid
liquid
liquid
gas
solid
gas
6.1.1 Solid-Liquid Equilibrium
Ice and water kept in a perfectly insulated
thermos flask (no exchange of heat between its
contents and the surroundings) at 273K and
the atmospheric pressure are in equilibrium
state and the system shows interesting

characteristic features. We observe that the
mass of ice and water do not change with
time and the temperature remains constant.
However, the equilibrium is not static.
The intense activity can be noticed at the
boundary between ice and water. Molecules
from the liquid water collide against ice and
adhere to it and some molecules of ice escape
into liquid phase. There is no change of mass
of ice and water, as the rates of transfer of
molecules from ice into water and of reverse
transfer from water into ice are equal at
atmospheric pressure and 273 K.
It is obvious that ice and water are in
equilibrium only at particular temperature
and pressure. For any pure substance at
atmospheric pressure, the temperature at
which the solid and liquid phases are at
equilibrium is called the normal melting point
or normal freezing point of the substance. The
system here is in dynamic equilibrium and we
can infer the following:
(i)
Both the opposing processes occur
simultaneously.
(ii) Both the processes occur at the same
rate so that the amount of ice and water
remains constant.
6.1.2	Liquid-Vapour Equilibrium
This equilibrium can be better understood if
we consider the example of a transparent box
carrying a U-tube with mercury (manometer).
Drying agent like anhydrous calcium chloride
(or phosphorus penta-oxide) is placed for
a few hours in the box. After removing the
drying agent by tilting the box on one side, a
watch glass (or petri dish) containing water
is quickly placed inside the box. It will be
observed that the mercury level in the right
limb of the manometer slowly increases and
finally attains a constant value, that is, the
pressure inside the box increases and reaches
a constant value. Also the volume of water in
the watch glass decreases (Fig. 6.1). Initially
there was no water vapour (or very less) inside
the box. As water evaporated the pressure in
the box increased due to addition of water
molecules into the gaseous phase inside
the box. The rate of evaporation is constant.

chemistry

Fig. 6.1 Measuring equilibrium vapour pressure of water at a constant temperature

However, the rate of increase in pressure
decreases with time due to condensation
of vapour into water. Finally it leads to an
equilibrium condition when there is no net
evaporation. This implies that the number
of water molecules from the gaseous state
into the liquid state also increases till the
equilibrium is attained i.e.,
rate of evaporation= rate of condensation
H2O (vap)
H2O(l)
At equilibrium the pressure exerted by
the water molecules at a given temperature
remains constant and is called the equilibrium
vapour pressure of water (or just vapour
pressure of water); vapour pressure of water
increases with temperature. If the above
experiment is repeated with methyl alcohol,
acetone and ether, it is observed that different
liquids have different equilibrium vapour
pressures at the same temperature, and the
liquid which has a higher vapour pressure is
more volatile and has a lower boiling point.
If we expose three watch glasses containing
separately 1mL each of acetone, ethyl alcohol,
and water to atmosphere and repeat the
experiment with different volumes of the
liquids in a warmer room, it is observed
that in all such cases the liquid eventually
disappears and the time taken for complete
evaporation depends on (i) the nature of the
liquid, (ii) the amount of the liquid and (iii) the
temperature. When the watch glass is open
to the atmosphere, the rate of evaporation
remains constant but the molecules are
dispersed into large volume of the room. As
a consequence the rate of condensation from

vapour to liquid state is much less than the
rate of evaporation. These are open systems
and it is not possible to reach equilibrium in
an open system.
Water and water vapour are in equilibrium
position at atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar)
and at 100°C in a closed vessel. The boiling
point of water is 100°C at 1.013 bar pressure.
For any pure liquid at one atmospheric
pressure (1.013 bar), the temperature
at which the liquid and vapours are at
equilibrium is called normal boiling point of
the liquid. Boiling point of the liquid depends
on the atmospheric pressure. It depends on
the altitude of the place; at high altitude the
boiling point decreases.
6.1.3 Solid – Vapour Equilibrium
Let us now consider the systems where solids
sublime to vapour phase. If we place solid
iodine in a closed vessel, after sometime
the vessel gets filled up with violet vapour
and the intensity of colour increases with
time. After certain time the intensity of
colour becomes constant and at this stage
equilibrium is attained. Hence solid iodine
sublimes to give iodine vapour and the iodine
vapour condenses to give solid iodine. The
equilibrium can be represented as,
I2(solid)

I2 (vapour)

Other examples showing this kind of
equilibrium are,
Camphor (solid)
NH4Cl (solid)

6.1.4 Equilibrium Involving Dissolution
of Solid or Gases in Liquids
Solids in liquids
We know from our experience that we can
dissolve only a limited amount of salt or
sugar in a given amount of water at room
temperature. If we make a thick sugar syrup
solution by dissolving sugar at a higher
temperature, sugar crystals separate out if we
cool the syrup to the room temperature. We call
it a saturated solution when no more of solute
can be dissolved in it at a given temperature.
The concentration of the solute in a saturated
solution depends upon the temperature. In
a saturated solution, a dynamic equilibrium
exits between the solute molecules in the solid
state and in the solution:
Sugar (solid), and
Sugar (solution)
the rate of dissolution of sugar = rate of
crystallisation of sugar.
Equality of the two rates and dynamic
nature of equilibrium has been confirmed with
the help of radioactive sugar. If we drop some
radioactive sugar into saturated solution of
non-radioactive sugar, then after some time
radioactivity is observed both in the solution
and in the solid sugar. Initially there were no
radioactive sugar molecules in the solution
but due to dynamic nature of equilibrium,
there is exchange between the radioactive
and non-radioactive sugar molecules between
the two phases. The ratio of the radioactive
to non-radioactive molecules in the solution
increases till it attains a constant value.
Gases in liquids
When a soda water bottle is opened, some of
the carbon dioxide gas dissolved in it fizzes
out rapidly. The phenomenon arises due
to difference in solubility of carbon dioxide
at different pressures. There is equilibrium
between the molecules in the gaseous state
and the molecules dissolved in the liquid
under pressure i.e.,
CO2 (gas)
CO2 (in solution)
This equilibrium is governed by Henry’s
law, which states that the mass of a gas
dissolved in a given mass of a solvent at
any temperature is proportional to the

pressure of the gas above the solvent.
This amount decreases with increase of
temperature. The soda water bottle is sealed
under pressure of gas when its solubility in
water is high. As soon as the bottle is opened,
some of the dissolved carbon dioxide gas
escapes to reach a new equilibrium condition
required for the lower pressure, namely its
partial pressure in the atmosphere. This is
how the soda water in bottle when left open
to the air for some time, turns ‘flat’. It can be
generalised that:
(i)
For solid
liquid equilibrium, there is
only one temperature (melting point) at
1 atm (1.013 bar) at which the two
phases can coexist. If there is no
exchange of heat with the surroundings,
the mass of the two phases remains
constant.
(ii) For liquid
vapour equilibrium, the
vapour pressure is constant at a given
temperature.
(iii) For dissolution of solids in liquids,
the solubility is constant at a given
temperature.
(iv) For dissolution of gases in liquids,
the concentration of a gas in liquid
is proportional to the pressure
(concentration) of the gas over the liquid.
These observations are summarised in

6.1.5 General Characteristics of
Equilibria Involving Physical
Processes
For the physical processes discussed above,
following characteristics are common to the
system at equilibrium:
(i)
Equilibrium is possible only in a closed
system at a given temperature.
(ii) Both the opposing processes occur at
the same rate and there is a dynamic
but stable condition.
(iii) All measurable properties of the system
remain constant.
(iv) When equilibrium is attained for a
physical process, it is characterised by
constant value of one of its parameters
at a given temperature. Table 6.1 lists
such quantities.
(v) The magnitude of such quantities at any
stage indicates the extent to which the
physical process has proceeded before
reaching equilibrium.
6.2

EQUILIBRIUM IN CHEMICAL
PROCESSES – DYNAMIC
EQUILIBRIUM
Analogous to the physical systems chemical
reactions also attain a state of equilibrium.
These reactions can occur both in forward
and backward directions. When the rates of
the forward and reverse reactions become
equal, the concentrations of the reactants
and the products remain constant. This
is the stage of chemical equilibrium. This
equilibrium is dynamic in nature as it consists
of a forward reaction in which the reactants
give product(s) and reverse reaction in which
product(s) gives the original reactants.
For a better comprehension, let us consider
a general case of a reversible reaction,
A+B

C+D

With passage of time, there is
accumulation of the products C and D and
depletion of the reactants A and B (Fig. 6.2).
This leads to a decrease in the rate of
forward reaction and an increase in the rate
of the reverse reaction,

Fig. 6.2 Attainment of chemical equilibrium.

Eventually, the two reactions occur at the
same rate and the system reaches a state of
equilibrium.
Similarly, the reaction can reach the state
of equilibrium even if we start with only C and
D; that is, no A and B being present initially,
as the equilibrium can be reached from either
direction.
The dynamic nature of chemical
equilibrium can be demonstrated in the
synthesis of ammonia by Haber’s process.
In a series of experiments, Haber started
with known amounts of dinitrogen and
dihydrogen maintained at high temperature
and pressure and at regular intervals
determined the amount of ammonia present.
He was successful in determining also the
concentration of unreacted dihydrogen and
dinitrogen. Fig. 6.4 (page 174) shows that after
a certain time the composition of the mixture
remains the same even though some of the
reactants are still present. This constancy in
composition indicates that the reaction has
reached equilibrium. In order to understand
the dynamic nature of the reaction, synthesis
of ammonia is carried out with exactly the
same starting conditions (of partial pressure
and temperature) but using D2 (deuterium)
in place of H2. The reaction mixtures starting
either with H2 or D2 reach equilibrium with
the same composition, except that D2 and
ND3 are present instead of H2 and NH3. After

Dynamic Equilibrium – A Student’s Activity
Equilibrium whether in a physical or in a chemical system, is always of dynamic nature. This can
be demonstrated by the use of radioactive isotopes. This is not feasible in a school laboratory.
However this concept can be easily comprehended by performing the following activity. The activity
can be performed in a group of 5 or 6 students.
Take two 100mL measuring cylinders (marked as 1 and 2) and two glass tubes each of
30 cm length. Diameter of the tubes may be same or different in the range of 3-5mm. Fill
nearly half of the measuring cylinder-1 with coloured water (for this purpose add a crystal
of potassium permanganate to water) and keep second cylinder (number 2) empty.
Put one tube in cylinder 1 and second in cylinder 2. Immerse one tube in cylinder 1,
close its upper tip with a finger and transfer the coloured water contained in its lower portion to
cylinder 2. Using second tube, kept in 2nd cylinder, transfer the coloured water in a similar manner
from cylinder 2 to cylinder 1. In this way keep on transferring coloured water using the two glass
tubes from cylinder 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1 till you notice that the level of coloured water in both
the cylinders becomes constant.
If you continue intertransferring coloured solution between the cylinders, there will not be
any further change in the levels of coloured water in two cylinders. If we take analogy of ‘level’ of
coloured water with ‘concentration’ of reactants and products in the two cylinders, we can say
the process of transfer, which continues even after the constancy of level, is indicative of dynamic
nature of the process. If we repeat the experiment taking two tubes of different diameters we find
that at equilibrium the level of coloured water in two cylinders is different. How far diameters are
responsible for change in levels in two cylinders? Empty cylinder (2) is an indicator of no product
in it at the beginning.

equilibrium is attained, these two mixtures
(H 2, N 2, NH 3 and D 2, N 2, ND 3) are mixed
together and left for a while. Later, when
this mixture is analysed, it is found that the
concentration of ammonia is just the same
as before. However, when this mixture is
analysed by a mass spectrometer, it is found
that ammonia and all deuterium containing
forms of ammonia (NH3, NH2D, NHD2 and
ND3) and dihydrogen and its deutrated forms
(H2, HD and D2) are present. Thus one can
conclude that scrambling of H and D atoms in
the molecules must result from a continuation
of the forward and reverse reactions in the
mixture. If the reaction had simply stopped
when they reached equilibrium, then there
would have been no mixing of isotopes in
this way.
Use of isotope (deuterium) in the formation
of ammonia clearly indicates that chemical
reactions reach a state of dynamic
equilibrium in which the rates of forward
and reverse reactions are equal and there
is no net change in composition.
Equilibrium can be attained from both
sides, whether we start reaction by taking,
H2(g) and N2(g) and get NH3(g) or by taking
NH3(g) and decomposing it into N2(g) and H2(g).
N2(g) + 3H2(g)

2NH3(g)

N2(g) + 3H2(g)

Similarly let us consider the reaction,
2HI(g). If we start with
H 2 (g) + I 2 (g)
equal initial concentration of H2 and I2, the
reaction proceeds in the forward direction
and the concentration of H2 and I2 decreases
while that of HI increases, until all of these
become constant at equilibrium (Fig. 6.5). We
can also start with HI alone and make the
reaction to proceed in the reverse direction;
the concentration of HI will decrease and
concentration of H2 and I2 will increase until
they all become constant when equilibrium is
reached (Fig. 6.5). If total number of H and I
atoms are same in a given volume, the same
equilibrium mixture is obtained whether we
start it from pure reactants or pure product.

6.3	LAW OF CHEMICAL EQUILIBRIUM
AND EQUILIBRIUM CONSTANT
A mixture of reactants and products in the
equilibrium state is called an equilibrium
mixture. In this section we shall address a
number of important questions about the
composition of equilibrium mixtures: What is
the relationship between the concentrations
of reactants and products in an equilibrium
mixture? How can we determine equilibrium
concentrations from initial concentrations?
What factors can be exploited to alter the

EQUILIBRIUM

175

composition of an equilibrium mixture? The
last question in particular is important when
choosing conditions for synthesis of industrial
chemicals such as H2, NH3, CaO etc.
To answer these questions, let us consider
a general reversible reaction:
C+D
A+B
where A and B are the reactants, C and D
are the products in the balanced chemical
equation. On the basis of experimental studies
of many reversible reactions, the Norwegian
chemists Cato Maximillian Guldberg and
Peter Waage proposed in 1864 that the
concentrations in an equilibrium mixture
are related by the following equilibrium
equation,

CD        
(6.1)
Kc 
A
B



		
(6.1) where Kc is the equilibrium constant and
the expression on the right side is called the
equilibrium constant expression.
The equilibrium equation is also known as
the law of mass action because in the early
days of chemistry, concentration was called
“active mass”. In order to appreciate their
work better, let us consider reaction between
gaseous H2 and I2 carried out in a sealed vessel
at 731K.
H2(g) + I2(g)   2HI(g)
1 mol 1 mol
2 mol

Six sets of experiments with varying initial
conditions were performed, starting with only
gaseous H2 and I2 in a sealed reaction vessel
in first four experiments (1, 2, 3 and 4) and
only HI in other two experiments (5 and 6).
Experiment 1, 2, 3 and 4 were performed
taking different concentrations of H2 and / or
I2, and with time it was observed that intensity
of the purple colour remained constant and
equilibrium was attained. Similarly, for
experiments 5 and 6, the equilibrium was
attained from the opposite direction.
Data obtained from all six sets of
experiments are given in Table 6.2.
It is evident from the experiments 1, 2,
3 and 4 that number of moles of dihydrogen
reacted = number of moles of iodine reacted
= ½ (number of moles of HI formed). Also,
experiments 5 and 6 indicate that,
[H2(g)]eq = [I2(g)]eq
Knowing the above facts, in order
to establish a relationship between
concentrations of the reactants and products,
several combinations can be tried. Let us
consider the simple expression,
[HI(g)]eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq
It can be seen from Table 6.3 that if we
put the equilibrium concentrations of the
reactants and products, the above expression

Table 6.3

Expression Involving the

Reactants
H2(g) + I2(g)
2HI(g)

The equilibrium constant for a general
reaction,
aA + bB

cC + dD

is expressed as,
Kc = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b

(6.4)

where [A], [B], [C] and [D] are the equilibrium
concentrations of the reactants and products.
Equilibrium constant for the reaction,
4NO(g) + 6H2O(g) is written
4NH3(g) + 5O2(g)
as
Kc = [NO]4[H2O]6 / [NH3]4 [O2]5
is far from constant. However, if we consider
the expression,
[HI(g)]2eq / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq
we find that this expression gives constant
value (as shown in Table 6.3) in all the six
cases. It can be seen that in this expression
the power of the concentration for reactants
and products are actually the stoichiometric
coefficients in the equation for the chemical
reaction. Thus, for the reaction H2(g) + I2(g)
2HI(g), following equation 6.1, the equilibrium
constant Kc is written as,
Kc = [HI(g)]eq2 / [H2(g)]eq [I2(g)]eq

(6.2)

Generally the subscript ‘eq’ (used for
equilibrium) is omitted from the concentration
terms. It is taken for granted that the
concentrations in the expression for Kc are
equilibrium values. We, therefore, write,
Kc = [HI(g)]2 / [H2(g)] [I2(g)]

(6.3)

The subscript ‘c’ indicates that K c is
expressed in concentrations of mol L–1.
At a given temperature, the product of
concentrations of the reaction products
raised to the respective stoichiometric
coefficient in the balanced chemical
equation divided by the product of
concentrations of the reactants raised to
their individual stoichiometric coefficients
has a constant value. This is known as
the Equilibrium Law or Law of Chemical
Equilibrium.

Molar concentration of different species is
indicated by enclosing these in square bracket
and, as mentioned above, it is implied that
these are equilibrium concentrations. While
writing expression for equilibrium constant,
symbol for phases (s, l, g) are generally ignored.
Let us write equilibrium constant for the
reaction, H2(g) + I2(g)

2HI(g)

(6.5)

as, Kc = [HI]2 / [H2] [I2] = x

(6.6)

The equilibrium constant for the reverse
reaction, 2HI(g)
H2(g) + I2(g), at the same
temperature is,
K′c = [H2] [I2] / [HI]2 = 1/ x = 1 / Kc
Thus, K′c = 1 / Kc

(6.7)
(6.8)

Equilibrium constant for the reverse
reaction is the inverse of the equilibrium
constant for the reaction in the forward
direction.
If we change the stoichiometric coefficients
in a chemical equation by multiplying
throughout by a factor then we must make
sure that the expression for equilibrium
constant also reflects that change. For
example, if the reaction (6.5) is written as,
½ H2(g) + ½ I2(g)
HI(g)
(6.9)
the equilibrium constant for the above
reaction is given by
K″c = [HI] / [H2]1/2[I2]1/2 = {[HI]2 / [H2][I2]}1/2
= x1/2 = Kc1/2 (6.10)
On multiplying the equation (6.5) by n, we get

EQUILIBRIUM

177

nH2(g) + nI2(g) D
2nHI(g)
(6.11)
Therefore, equilibrium constant for the
reaction is equal to Kc n. These findings are
summarised in Table 6.4. It should be noted
that because the equilibrium constants Kc
and K ′c have different numerical values, it is
important to specify the form of the balanced
chemical equation when quoting the value of
an equilibrium constant.

HOMOGENEOUS EQUILIBRIA

In a homogeneous system, all the reactants
and products are in the same phase.
For example, in the gaseous reaction,
2NH 3(g), reactants and
N 2(g) + 3H 2(g)
products are in the homogeneous phase.
Similarly, for the reactions,
CH3COOH (aq)
CH3COOC2H5 (aq) + H2O (l)
				
+ C2H5OH (aq)
Fe(SCN)2+ (aq)
and, Fe3+ (aq) + SCN–(aq)
all the reactants and products are in
homogeneous solution phase. We shall now
consider equilibrium constant for some
homogeneous reactions.
6.4.1 Equilibrium Constant in Gaseous
Systems
So far we have expressed equilibrium
constant of the reactions in terms of molar
concentration of the reactants and products,
and used symbol, Kc for it. For reactions
involving gases, however, it is usually more
convenient to express the equilibrium
constant in terms of partial pressure.

What will be Kc for the reaction

The ideal gas equation is written as,
pV = nRT
n
⇒ p = RT
V
Here, p is the pressure in Pa, n is the number
of moles of the gas, V is the volume in m3 and
T is the temperature in Kelvin

chemistry

Therefore,
n/V is concentration expressed in mol/m3
If concentration c, is in mol/L or mol/dm3,
and p is in bar then
p = cRT,
We can also write p = [gas]RT.
Here, R= 0.0831 bar litre/mol K
At constant temperature, the pressure of
the gas is proportional to its concentration i.e.,
p ∝ [gas]
For reaction in equilibrium
H2(g) + I2(g)

We can write either

It is necessary that while calculating the value
of Kp, pressure should be expressed in bar
because standard state for pressure is 1 bar.

1pascal, Pa=1Nm–2, and 1bar = 105 Pa

HETEROGENEOUS EQUILIBRIA

Equilibrium in a system having more than one
phase is called heterogeneous equilibrium.
The equilibrium between water vapour and
liquid water in a closed container is an
example of heterogeneous equilibrium.
H2O(l)

H2O(g)

In this example, there is a gas phase and
a liquid phase. In the same way, equilibrium
between a solid and its saturated solution,
Ca(OH)2 (s) + (aq)

Ca2+ (aq) + 2OH–(aq)

is a heterogeneous equilibrium.
Heterogeneous equilibria often involve
pure solids or liquids. We can simplify
equilibrium expressions for the heterogeneous
equilibria involving a pure liquid or a pure
solid, as the molar concentration of a pure
solid or liquid is constant (i.e., independent
of the amount present). In other words if a
substance ‘X’ is involved, then [X(s)] and [X(l)]
are constant, whatever the amount of ‘X’ is
taken. Contrary to this, [X(g)] and [X(aq)] will

chemistry

vary as the amount of X in a given volume
varies. Let us take thermal dissociation of
calcium carbonate which is an interesting and
important example of heterogeneous chemical
equilibrium.
CaCO3 (s)

CaO (s) + CO2 (g)

(6.16)

On the basis of the stoichiometric equation,
we can write,

Kc 

CaO  s  CO2  g 
CaCO3  s 

Since [CaCO3(s)] and [CaO(s)] are both
constant, therefore modified equilibrium
constant for the thermal decomposition of
calcium carbonate will be
K´c = [CO2(g)]
or Kp = pCO
2

(6.17)
(6.18)

Units of Equilibrium Constant
The value of equilibrium constant Kc can be
calculated by substituting the concentration
terms in mol/L and for Kp partial pressure
is substituted in Pa, kPa, bar or atm. This
results in units of equilibrium constant based
on molarity or pressure, unless the exponents
of both the numerator and denominator are
same.
For the reactions,
H2(g) + I2(g)
2HI, Kc and Kp have no
unit.
N2O4(g)
2NO2 (g), Kc has unit mol/L
and Kp has unit bar
Equilibrium constants can also be
expressed as dimensionless quantities if the
standard state of reactants and products
are specified. For a pure gas, the standard
state is 1bar. Therefore a pressure of 4 bar
in standard state can be expressed as 4
bar/1 bar = 4, which is a dimensionless
number. Standard state (c0) for a solute is 1
molar solution and all concentrations can be
measured with respect to it. The numerical
value of equilibrium constant depends on the
standard state chosen. Thus, in this system
both Kp and Kc are dimensionless quantities
but have different numerical values due to
different standard states.

This shows that at a particular
temperature, there is a constant concentration
or pressure of CO2 in equilibrium with CaO(s)
and CaCO3(s). Experimentally it has been
found that at 1100 K, the pressure of CO2
in equilibrium with CaCO3(s) and CaO(s), is
2.0 ×105 Pa. Therefore, equilibrium constant
at 1100K for the above reaction is:

APPLICATIONS OF EQUILIBRIUM
CONSTANTS
Before considering the applications of
equilibrium constants, let us summarise the
important features of equilibrium constants
as follows:
1. Expression for equilibrium constant is
applicable only when concentrations of
the reactants and products have attained
constant value at equilibrium state.
2. The value of equilibrium constant is
independent of initial concentrations of
the reactants and products.
3. Equilibrium constant is temperature
dependent having one unique value for
a particular reaction represented by a
balanced equation at a given temperature.
4. The equilibrium constant for the reverse
reaction is equal to the inverse of the
equilibrium constant for the forward
reaction.

•

predict the direction of the reaction, and

•

calculate equilibrium concentrations.

6.6.1 Predicting the Extent of a
Reaction
The numerical value of the equilibrium
constant for a reaction indicates the extent
of the reaction. But it is important to note
that an equilibrium constant does not give
any information about the rate at which
the equilibrium is reached. The magnitude
of Kc or Kp is directly proportional to the
concentrations of products (as these appear
in the numerator of equilibrium constant
expression) and inversely proportional to the
concentrations of the reactants (these appear
in the denominator). This implies that a high
value of K is suggestive of a high concentration
of products and vice-versa.
We can make the following generalisations
concerning the composition of equilibrium
mixtures:

•

If Kc > 103, products predominate over
reactants, i.e., if Kc is very large, the
reaction proceeds nearly to completion.
Consider the following examples:
(a) The reaction of H 2 with O 2 at 500 K
has a very large equilibrium constant,
Kc = 2.4 × 1047.
(b) H2(g) + Cl 2(g)
2HCl(g) at 300K has
Kc = 4.0 × 1031.
2HBr (g) at 300 K,
(c) H 2(g) + Br 2(g)
Kc = 5.4 × 1018

•

If Kc < 10–3, reactants predominate over
products, i.e., if Kc is very small, the
reaction proceeds rarely. Consider the
following examples:

9/12/2022 11:58:24 AM

182

chemistry

(a) The decomposition of H2O into H2 and
O2 at 500 K has a very small equilibrium
constant, Kc = 4.1 × 10 –48
(b) N2(g) + O2(g)
2NO(g),
at 298 K has Kc = 4.8 ×10 – 31.

•

If K c is in the range of 10 – 3 to 10 3 ,
appreciable concentrations of both
reactants and products are present.
Consider the following examples:
(a) For reaction of H2 with I2 to give HI,
Kc = 57.0 at 700K.
(b) Also, gas phase decomposition of N2O4
to NO2 is another reaction with a value
of K c = 4.64 × 10 –3 at 25°C which is
neither too small nor too large. Hence,
equilibrium mixtures contain appreciable
concentrations of both N2O4 and NO2.
These generarlisations are illustrated in
Fig. 6.6

Fig.6.6

Dependence of extent of reaction on Kc

If Qc = Kc, the reaction mixture is already
at equilibrium.
Consider the gaseous reaction of H 2
with I2,
H2(g) + I2(g)
2HI(g); Kc = 57.0 at 700 K.
Suppose we have molar concentrations
[H2]t=0.10M, [I2]t = 0.20 M and [HI]t = 0.40 M.
(the subscript t on the concentration symbols
means that the concentrations were measured
at some arbitrary time t, not necessarily at
equilibrium).
Thus, the reaction quotient, Qc at this
stage of the reaction is given by,
Qc = [HI]t2 / [H2]t [I2]t = (0.40)2/ (0.10)×(0.20)
= 8.0
Now, in this case, Qc (8.0) does not equal
Kc (57.0), so the mixture of H2(g), I2(g) and HI(g)
is not at equilibrium; that is, more H2(g) and
I2(g) will react to form more HI(g) and their
concentrations will decrease till Qc = Kc.
The reaction quotient, Q c is useful in
predicting the direction of reaction by
comparing the values of Qc and Kc.
Thus, we can make the following
generalisations concerning the direction of
the reaction (Fig. 6.7) :

6.6.2 Predicting the Direction of the
Reaction
The equilibrium constant helps in predicting
the direction in which a given reaction will
proceed at any stage. For this purpose,
we calculate the reaction quotient Q.
The reaction quotient, Q (Q c with molar
concentrations and QP with partial pressures)
is defined in the same way as the equilibrium
constant Kc except that the concentrations
in Qc are not necessarily equilibrium values.
For a general reaction:
aA+bB
c C + d D		
(6.19)
(6.20)
Qc = [C]c[D]d / [A]a[B]b		
Then,
If Qc > Kc, the reaction will proceed in the
direction of reactants (reverse reaction).
If Qc < Kc, the reaction will proceed in the
direction of the products (forward reaction).

If Qc < Kc, net reaction goes from left to
right
If Qc > Kc, net reaction goes from right to
left.
If Qc = Kc, no net reaction occurs.

the composition of reaction mixture is

the reaction will proceed?

183

Solution
For the reaction the reaction quotient Qc is
given by,
Qc = [B][C]/ [A]2
as [A] = [B] = [C] = 3 × 10–4M
Qc = (3 ×10–4)(3 × 10 –4) / (3 ×10 –4)2 = 1
as Qc > Kc so the reaction will proceed in the
reverse direction.
6.6.3 Calculating Equilibrium
Concentrations
In case of a problem in which we know the
initial concentrations but do not know any of
the equilibrium concentrations, the following
three steps shall be followed:
Step 1. Write the balanced equation for the
reaction.
Step 2. Under the balanced equation, make
a table that lists for each substance involved
in the reaction:
(a) the initial concentration,
(b) the change in concentration on going to
equilibrium, and
(c) the equilibrium concentration.
In constructing the table, define x as the
concentration (mol/L) of one of the substances
that reacts on going to equilibrium, then use
the stoichiometry of the reaction to determine
the concentrations of the other substances in
terms of x.
Step 3. Substitute the equilibrium
concentrations into the equilibrium equation
for the reaction and solve for x. If you are
to solve a quadratic equation choose the
mathematical solution that makes chemical
sense.
Step 4. Calculate the equilibrium
concentrations from the calculated value of x.
Step 5. Check your results by substituting
them into the equilibrium equation.

Gas constant (R) = 0.083 bar L mol–1K–1

Kc = [PCl3][Cl2]/[PCl5]

Taking antilog of both sides, we get,
		 K = e–∆G/RT
		
(6.23)
Hence, using the equation (6.23), the
reaction spontaneity can be interpreted in
terms of the value of ∆G .

•

If ∆G  < 0, then –∆G /RT is positive,
and e –∆DG /RT>1, making K >1, which
implies a spontaneous reaction or the
reaction which proceeds in the forward
direction to such an extent that the
products are present predominantly.

•

If ∆G  > 0, then –∆G /RT is negative, and

e –∆G </RT 1, that is , K < 1, which implies
a non-spontaneous reaction or a reaction
which proceeds in the forward direction
to such a small degree that only a very
minute quantity of product is formed.

x = [–1.8 ± √(1.8)2 – 4(–5.4)]/2
x = [–1.8 ± √3.24 + 21.6]/2
x = [–1.8 ± 4.98]/2
x = [–1.8 + 4.98]/2 = 1.59
[PCl5] = 3.0 – x = 3 –1.59 = 1.41 M
[PCl3] = [Cl2] = x = 1.59 M
6.7	Relationship between
Equilibrium Constant K,
Reaction Quotient Q and
Gibbs Energy G
The value of Kc for a reaction does not depend
on the rate of the reaction. However, as you
have studied in Unit 5, it is directly related
to the thermodynamics of the reaction and
in particular, to the change in Gibbs energy,
∆G. If,
• ∆G is negative, then the reaction is
spontaneous and proceeds in the forward
direction.
• ∆G is positive, then reaction is considered
non-spontaneous. Instead, as reverse
reaction would have a negative ∆G, the
products of the forward reaction shall be
converted to the reactants.
• ∆G is 0, reaction has achieved equilibrium;
at this point, there is no longer any free
energy left to drive the reaction.
A mathematical expression of this
thermodynamic view of equilibrium can be
described by the following equation:
∆G = ∆G + RT lnQ
(6.21)

where, G is standard Gibbs energy.
At equilibrium, when ∆G = 0 and Q = Kc,
the equation (6.21) becomes,
∆G = ∆G + RT ln K = 0
∆G = – RT lnK
lnK = – ∆G / RT

(6.22)

Problem 6.10
The value of ∆G  for the phosphorylation of
glucose in glycolysis is 13.8 kJ/mol. Find
the value of Kc at 298 K.
Solution
∆G  = 13.8 kJ/mol = 13.8 × 103J/mol
Also, ∆G  = – RT lnKc
Hence, ln Kc = –13.8 × 103J/mol 			
(8.314 J mol –1K –1 × 298 K)
			
ln Kc = – 5.569
Kc = e–5.569
Kc = 3.81 × 10 –3

Hydrolysis of sucrose gives,
Sucrose + H2O

Glucose + Fructose

Equilibrium constant Kc for the reaction is
2 ×1013 at 300K. Calculate ∆G  at 300K.
Solution
∆G  = – RT lnKc
∆G  = – 8.314J mol–1K–1×
			
300K × ln(2×1013)
∆G  = – 7.64 ×104 J mol–1
6.8 FACTORS AFFECTING EQUILIBRIA
One of the principal goals of chemical
synthesis is to maximise the conversion of the



Unit 6.indd 184

9/12/2022 11:58:25 AM

EQUILIBRIUM

185

reactants to products while minimising the
expenditure of energy. This implies maximum
yield of products at mild temperature and
pressure conditions. If it does not happen,
then the experimental conditions need to be
adjusted. For example, in the Haber process
for the synthesis of ammonia from N2 and
H2, the choice of experimental conditions is
of real economic importance. Annual world
production of ammonia is about hundred
million tones, primarily for use as fertilisers.
Equilibrium constant, Kc is independent
of initial concentrations. But if a system at
equilibrium is subjected to a change in the
concentration of one or more of the reacting
substances, then the system is no longer at
equilibrium; and net reaction takes place in
some direction until the system returns to
equilibrium once again. Similarly, a change
in temperature or pressure of the system may
also alter the equilibrium. In order to decide
what course the reaction adopts and make
a qualitative prediction about the effect of a
change in conditions on equilibrium we use
Le Chatelier’s principle. It states that a
change in any of the factors that determine
the equilibrium conditions of a system
will cause the system to change in such a
manner so as to reduce or to counteract
the effect of the change. This is applicable
to all physical and chemical equilibria.

“When the concentration of any of the
reactants or products in a reaction at
equilibrium is changed, the composition
of the equilibrium mixture changes so as
to minimize the effect of concentration
changes”.
Let us take the reaction,
H2(g) + I2(g)

2HI(g)

If H2 is added to the reaction mixture
at equilibrium, then the equilibrium of the
reaction is disturbed. In order to restore it,
the reaction proceeds in a direction wherein
H2 is consumed, i.e., more of H2 and I2 react
to form HI and finally the equilibrium shifts
in right (forward) direction (Fig.6.8). This is in
accordance with the Le Chatelier’s principle
which implies that in case of addition of a
reactant/product, a new equilibrium will
be set up in which the concentration of the
reactant/product should be less than what it
was after the addition but more than what it
was in the original mixture.

We shall now be discussing factors which
can influence the equilibrium.
6.8.1 Effect of Concentration Change
In general, when equilibrium is disturbed
by the addition/removal of any reactant/
products, Le Chatelier’s principle predicts
that:
•

•

The concentration stress of an added
reactant/product is relieved by net
reaction in the direction that consumes
the added substance.
The concentration stress of a removed
reactant/product is relieved by net
reaction in the direction that replenishes
the removed substance.
or in other words,

Fig. 6.8

Effect of addition of H 2 on change
of concentration for the reactants
and products in the reaction,
2HI(g)
H2(g) + I2 (g)

The same point can be explained in terms
of the reaction quotient, Qc,
Qc = [HI]2/ [H2][I2]



Unit 6.indd 185

11/30/2022 15:48:33

186

chemistry

Addition of hydrogen at equilibrium
results in value of Qc being less than Kc . Thus,
in order to attain equilibrium again reaction
moves in the forward direction. Similarly,
we can say that removal of a product also
boosts the forward reaction and increases
the concentration of the products and this
has great commercial application in cases
of reactions, where the product is a gas or a
volatile substance. In case of manufacture of
ammonia, ammonia is liquified and removed
from the reaction mixture so that reaction
keeps moving in forward direction. Similarly,
in the large scale production of CaO (used
as important building material) from CaCO3,
constant removal of CO2 from the kiln drives
the reaction to completion. It should be
remembered that continuous removal of a
product maintains Qc at a value less than Kc
and reaction continues to move in the forward
direction.
Effect of Concentration – An experiment
This can be demonstrated by the following
reaction:
Fe3+(aq)+ SCN –(aq)
[Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)
(6.24)
yellow
colourless
deep red

(6.25)
A reddish colour appears on adding two
drops of 0.002 M potassium thiocynate solution
to 1 mL of 0.2 M iron(III) nitrate solution due
to the formation of [Fe(SCN)]2+. The intensity
of the red colour becomes constant on
attaining equilibrium. This equilibrium can be
shifted in either forward or reverse directions
depending on our choice of adding a reactant
or a product. The equilibrium can be shifted
in the opposite direction by adding reagents
that remove Fe3+ or SCN – ions. For example,
oxalic acid (H2C2O4), reacts with Fe3+ ions
to form the stable complex ion [Fe(C2O4)3]3–,
thus decreasing the concentration of free
Fe3+(aq). In accordance with the Le Chatelier’s
principle, the concentration stress of removed
Fe3+ is relieved by dissociation of [Fe(SCN)]2+
to replenish the Fe 3+ ions. Because the

concentration of [Fe(SCN)]2+ decreases, the
intensity of red colour decreases.
Addition of aq. HgCl2 also decreases red
colour because Hg2+ reacts with SCN– ions to
form stable complex ion [Hg(SCN)4]2–. Removal
of free SCN – (aq) shifts the equilibrium
in equation (6.24) from right to left to
replenish SCN – ions. Addition of potassium
thiocyanate on the other hand increases the
colour intensity of the solution as it shift the
equilibrium to right.
6.8.2 Effect of Pressure Change
A pressure change obtained by changing the
volume can affect the yield of products in
case of a gaseous reaction where the total
number of moles of gaseous reactants and
total number of moles of gaseous products are
different. In applying Le Chatelier’s principle
to a heterogeneous equilibrium the effect
of pressure changes on solids and liquids
can be ignored because the volume (and
concentration) of a solution/liquid is nearly
independent of pressure.
Consider the reaction,
CH4(g) + H2O(g)
CO(g) + 3H2(g)
Here, 4 mol of gaseous reactants (CO + 3H2)
become 2 mol of gaseous products (CH4 +
H2O). Suppose equilibrium mixture (for above
reaction) kept in a cylinder fitted with a piston
at constant temperature is compressed to
one half of its original volume. Then, total
pressure will be doubled (according to
pV = constant). The partial pressure and
therefore, concentration of reactants and
products have changed and the mixture is no
longer at equilibrium. The direction in which
the reaction goes to re-establish equilibrium
can be predicted by applying the Le Chatelier’s
principle. Since pressure has doubled,
the equilibrium now shifts in the forward
direction, a direction in which the number
of moles of the gas or pressure decreases (we
know pressure is proportional to moles of the
gas). This can also be understood by using
reaction quotient, Qc. Let [CO], [H2], [CH4]
and [H2O] be the molar concentrations at
equilibrium for methanation reaction. When
volume of the reaction mixture is halved, the



Unit 6.indd 186

9/12/2022 11:58:25 AM

EQUILIBRIUM

187

partial pressure and the concentration are
doubled. We obtain the reaction quotient by
replacing each equilibrium concentration by
double its value.

CH4 ( g ) H2O ( g )
Qc = 
3
CO ( g ) H2 ( g )
As Qc < Kc , the reaction proceeds in the
forward direction.
2CO(g), when
In reaction C(s) + CO2(g)
pressure is increased, the reaction goes in the
reverse direction because the number of moles
of gas increases in the forward direction.
6.8.3 Effect of Inert Gas Addition
If the volume is kept constant and an inert gas
such as argon is added which does not take
part in the reaction, the equilibrium remains
undisturbed. It is because the addition of
an inert gas at constant volume does not
change the partial pressures or the molar
concentrations of the substance involved in
the reaction. The reaction quotient changes
only if the added gas is a reactant or product
involved in the reaction.
6.8.4 Effect of Temperature Change
Whenever an equilibrium is disturbed by
a change in the concentration, pressure or
volume, the composition of the equilibrium
mixture changes because the reaction
quotient, Qc no longer equals the equilibrium
constant, Kc. However, when a change in
temperature occurs, the value of equilibrium
constant, Kc is changed.
In general, the temperature dependence
of the equilibrium constant depends on the
sign of ∆H for the reaction.

•

The equilibrium constant for an exothermic
reaction (negative ∆H) decreases as the
temperature increases.

•

The equilibrium constant for an
endothermic reaction (positive ∆H)
increases as the temperature increases.

Temperature changes affect the
equilibrium constant and rates of reactions.

Production of ammonia according to the
reaction,
N2(g) + 3H2(g)

2NH3(g);

∆H= – 92.38 kJ mol–1
is an exothermic process. According to
Le Chatelier’s principle, raising the
temperature shifts the equilibrium to left
and decreases the equilibrium concentration
of ammonia. In other words, low temperature
is favourable for high yield of ammonia, but
practically very low temperatures slow down
the reaction and thus a catalyst is used.
Effect of Temperature – An experiment
Effect of temperature on equilibrium can
be demonstrated by taking NO2 gas (brown
in colour) which dimerises into N 2O 4 gas
(colourless).
N2O4(g); ∆H = –57.2 kJ mol–1
2NO2(g)
NO 2 gas prepared by addition of Cu
turnings to conc. HNO3 is collected in two
5 mL test tubes (ensuring same intensity
of colour of gas in each tube) and stopper
sealed with araldite. Three 250 mL beakers
1, 2 and 3 containing freesing mixture, water
at room temperature and hot water (363K),
respectively, are taken (Fig. 6.9). Both the test
tubes are placed in beaker 2 for 8-10 minutes.
After this one is placed in beaker 1 and the
other in beaker 3. The effect of temperature
on direction of reaction is depicted very well
in this experiment. At low temperatures in
beaker 1, the forward reaction of formation of
N2O4 is preferred, as reaction is exothermic,
and thus, intensity of brown colour due
to NO2 decreases. While in beaker 3, high
temperature favours the reverse reaction of

chemistry

formation of NO2 and thus, the brown colour
intensifies.

Similarly, in manufacture of sulphuric
acid by contact process,

Effect of temperature can also be seen in
an endothermic reaction,
[Co(H2O) 6]3+ (aq) + 4Cl –(aq) [CoCl4]2–(aq) +
6H2O(l)

2SO3(g); Kc = 1.7 × 1026
2SO2(g) + O2(g)
though the value of K is suggestive of reaction
going to completion, but practically the
oxidation of SO2 to SO3 is very slow. Thus,
platinum or divanadium penta-oxide (V2O5)
is used as catalyst to increase the rate of the
reaction.
Note: If a reaction has an exceedingly small
K, a catalyst would be of little help.

colourless

blue

At room temperature, the equilibrium
mixture is blue due to [CoCl4]2–. When cooled
in a freesing mixture, the colour of the mixture
turns pink due to [Co(H2O)6]3+.
6.8.5 Effect of a Catalyst
A catalyst increases the rate of the chemical
reaction by making available a new low energy
pathway for the conversion of reactants to
products. It increases the rate of forward
and reverse reactions that pass through the
same transition state and does not affect
equilibrium. Catalyst lowers the activation
energy for the forward and reverse reactions
by exactly the same amount. Catalyst does
not affect the equilibrium composition of
a reaction mixture. It does not appear in
the balanced chemical equation or in the
equilibrium constant expression.
Let us consider the formation of NH3
from dinitrogen and dihydrogen which is
highly exothermic reaction and proceeds
with decrease in total number of moles
formed as compared to the reactants.
Equilibrium constant decreases with increase
in temperature. At low temperature rate
decreases and it takes long time to reach at
equilibrium, whereas high temperatures give
satisfactory rates but poor yields.
German chemist, Fritz Haber discovered
that a catalyst consisting of iron catalyse
the reaction to occur at a satisfactory rate
at temperatures, where the equilibrium
concentration of NH3 is reasonably favourable.
Since the number of moles formed in the
reaction is less than those of reactants, the
yield of NH3 can be improved by increasing
the pressure.
Optimum conditions of temperature
and pressure for the synthesis of NH3 using
catalyst are around 500 °C and 200 atm.

IONIC EQUILIBRIUM IN SOLUTION

Under the effect of change of concentration
on the direction of equilibrium, you have
incidently come across with the following
equilibrium which involves ions:
[Fe(SCN)]2+(aq)
Fe3+(aq) + SCN–(aq)
There are numerous equilibria that involve
ions only. In the following sections we will
study the equilibria involving ions. It is well
known that the aqueous solution of sugar
does not conduct electricity. However, when
common salt (sodium chloride) is added
to water it conducts electricity. Also, the
conductance of electricity increases with an
increase in concentration of common salt.
Michael Faraday classified the substances
into two categories based on their ability
to conduct electricity. One category of
substances conduct electricity in their
aqueous solutions and are called electrolytes
while the other do not and are thus, referred to
as non-electrolytes. Faraday further classified
electrolytes into strong and weak electrolytes.
Strong electrolytes on dissolution in water
are ionized almost completely, while the weak
electrolytes are only partially dissociated.
For example, an aqueous solution of
sodium chloride is comprised entirely of
sodium ions and chloride ions, while that
of acetic acid mainly contains unionized
acetic acid molecules and only some acetate
ions and hydronium ions. This is because
there is almost 100% ionization in case
of sodium chloride as compared to less
than 5% ionization of acetic acid which is
a weak electrolyte. It should be noted

that in weak electrolytes, equilibrium is
established between ions and the unionized
molecules. This type of equilibrium involving
ions in aqueous solution is called ionic
equilibrium. Acids, bases and salts come
under the category of electrolytes and may act
as either strong or weak electrolytes.
6.10 ACIDS, BASES AND SALTS
Acids, bases and salts find widespread
occurrence in nature. Hydrochloric acid
present in the gastric juice is secreted by the
lining of our stomach in a significant amount
of 1.2-1.5 L/day and is essential for digestive
processes. Acetic acid is known to be the main
constituent of vinegar. Lemon and orange
juices contain citric and ascorbic acids, and
tartaric acid is found in tamarind paste. As
most of the acids taste sour, the word “acid”
has been derived from a latin word “acidus”
meaning sour. Acids are known to turn blue
litmus paper into red and liberate dihydrogen
on reacting with some metals. Similarly, bases
are known to turn red litmus paper blue, taste
bitter and feel soapy. A common example
of a base is washing soda used for washing
purposes. When acids and bases are mixed
in the right proportion they react with each
other to give salts. Some commonly known
examples of salts are sodium chloride, barium
sulphate, sodium nitrate. Sodium chloride
(common salt) is an important component of
our diet and is formed by reaction between
hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. It

exists in solid state as a cluster of positively
charged sodium ions and negatively charged
chloride ions which are held together due to
electrostatic interactions between oppositely
charged species (Fig.6.10). The electrostatic
forces between two charges are inversely
proportional to dielectric constant of the
medium. Water, a universal solvent, possesses
a very high dielectric constant of 80. Thus,
when sodium chloride is dissolved in water,
the electrostatic interactions are reduced by
a factor of 80 and this facilitates the ions to
move freely in the solution. Also, they are
well-separated due to hydration with water
molecules.

Fig.6.10 Dissolution of sodium chloride in water.
Na+ and Cl – ions are stablised by their
hydration with polar water molecules.

Comparing, the ionization of hydrochloric
acid with that of acetic acid in water we find
that though both of them are polar covalent

Faraday was born near London into a family of very limited means. At the age of
14 he was an apprentice to a kind bookbinder who allowed Faraday to read the
books he was binding. Through a fortunate chance he became laboratory assistant
to Davy, and during 1813-4, Faraday accompanied him to the Continent. During
this trip he gained much from the experience of coming into contact with many of the
leading scientists of the time. In 1825, he succeeded Davy as Director of the Royal
Institution laboratories, and in 1833 he also became the first Fullerian Professor of
Chemistry. Faraday’s first important work was on analytical chemistry. After 1821
Michael Faraday
much of his work was on electricity and magnetism and different electromagnetic
(1791–1867)
phenomena. His ideas have led to the establishment of modern field theory.  
He discovered his two laws of electrolysis in 1834. Faraday was a very modest and kind hearted
person.  He declined all honours and avoided scientific controversies. He preferred to work alone and
never had any assistant. He disseminated science in a variety of ways including his Friday evening
discourses, which he founded at the Royal Institution. He has been very famous for his Christmas
lecture on the ‘Chemical History of a Candle’.  He published nearly 450 scientific papers.

chemistry

molecules, former is completely ionized into
its constituent ions, while the latter is only
partially ionized (< 5%). The extent to which
ionization occurs depends upon the strength
of the bond and the extent of solvation
of ions produced. The terms dissociation
and ionization have earlier been used with
different meaning. Dissociation refers to the
process of separation of ions in water already
existing as such in the solid state of the solute,
as in sodium chloride. On the other hand,
ionization corresponds to a process in which
a neutral molecule splits into charged ions in
the solution. Here, we shall not distinguish
between the two and use the two terms
interchangeably.

Hydronium and Hydroxyl Ions
Hydrogen ion by itself is a bare proton with very
small size (~10–15 m radius) and intense electric
field, binds itself with the water molecule at
one of the two available lone pairs on it giving
H3O+. This species has been detected in many
compounds (e.g., H3O+Cl–) in the solid state. In
aqueous solution the hydronium ion is further
hydrated to give species like H5O2+, H7O3+ and
H9O4+. Similarly the hydroxyl ion is hydrated
to give several ionic species like H3O2–, H5O3–
and H7O4– etc.

6.10.1 Arrhenius Concept of Acids and
Bases
According to Arrhenius theory, acids are
substances that dissociates in water to
give hydrogen ions H +(aq) and bases are
substances that produce hydroxyl ions
OH –(aq). The ionization of an acid HX (aq) can
be represented by the following equations:
HX (aq) → H+(aq) + X– (aq)
or
HX(aq) + H2O(l) → H3O+(aq) + X –(aq)
A bare proton, H+ is very reactive and
cannot exist freely in aqueous solutions.
Thus, it bonds to the oxygen atom of a solvent
water molecule to give trigonal pyramidal
hydronium ion, H3O+ {[H (H2O)]+} (see box). In
this chapter we shall use H+(aq) and H3O+(aq)
interchangeably to mean the same i.e., a
hydrated proton.

H9O4+
6.10.2	The Brönsted-Lowry Acids and
Bases
The Danish chemist, Johannes Brönsted and
the English chemist, Thomas M. Lowry gave
a more general definition of acids and bases.
According to Brönsted-Lowry theory, acid
is a substance that is capable of donating a
hydrogen ion H+ and bases are substances
capable of accepting a hydrogen ion, H+. In
short, acids are proton donors and bases are
proton acceptors.
Consider the example of dissolution of NH3
in H2O represented by the following equation:

Similarly, a base molecule like MOH
ionizes in aqueous solution according to the
equation:
MOH(aq) → M+(aq) + OH–(aq)
The hydroxyl ion also exists in the hydrated
form in the aqueous solution. Arrhenius
concept of acid and base, however, suffers
from the limitation of being applicable only to
aqueous solutions and also, does not account
for the basicity of substances like, ammonia
which do not possess a hydroxyl group.

The basic solution is formed due to the
presence of hydroxyl ions. In this reaction,
water molecule acts as proton donor and
ammonia molecule acts as proton acceptor
and are thus, called Lowry-Brönsted acid and

Svante Arrhenius
(1859-1927)

191

Arrhenius was born near Uppsala, Sweden. He presented his thesis, on the
conductivities of electrolyte solutions, to the University of Uppsala in 1884. For the
next five years he travelled extensively and visited a number of research centers
in Europe. In 1895 he was appointed professor of physics at the newly formed
University of Stockholm, serving its rector from 1897 to 1902. From 1905 until his
death he was Director of physical chemistry at the Nobel Institute in Stockholm. He
continued to work for many years on electrolytic solutions. In 1899 he discussed
the temperature dependence of reaction rates on the basis of an equation, now
usually known as Arrhenius equation.
He worked in a variety of fields, and made important contributions to
immunochemistry, cosmology, the origin of life, and the causes of ice age. He was
the first to discuss the ‘green house effect’ calling by that name. He received Nobel
Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for his theory of electrolytic dissociation and its use in
the development of chemistry.

base, respectively. In the reverse reaction,
H+ is transferred from NH4+ to OH–. In this
case, NH 4+ acts as a Bronsted acid while
OH– acted as a Brönsted base. The acid-base
pair that differs only by one proton is called
a conjugate acid-base pair. Therefore, OH –
is called the conjugate base of an acid H2O
and NH4+ is called conjugate acid of the base
NH3. If Brönsted acid is a strong acid then
its conjugate base is a weak base and viceversa. It may be noted that conjugate acid
has one extra proton and each conjugate base
has one less proton.
Consider the example of ionization of
hydrochloric acid in water. HCl(aq) acts as
an acid by donating a proton to H2O molecule
which acts as a base.

in case of ammonia it acts as an acid by
donating a proton.
Problem 6.12
What will be the conjugate bases for the
following Brönsted acids: HF, H2SO4 and
HCO3– ?
Solution
The conjugate bases should have one
proton less in each case and therefore the
corresponding conjugate bases are: F –,
HSO4– and CO32– respectively.
Problem 6.13
Write the conjugate acids for the following
Brönsted bases: NH2–, NH3 and HCOO–.
Solution
The conjugate acid should have one extra
proton in each case and therefore the
corresponding conjugate acids are: NH3,
NH4+ and HCOOH respectively.
Problem 6.14

It can be seen in the above equation, that
water acts as a base because it accepts the
proton. The species H3O+ is produced when
water accepts a proton from HCl. Therefore,
Cl – is a conjugate base of HCl and HCl is the
conjugate acid of base Cl –. Similarly, H2O is
a conjugate base of an acid H3O+ and H3O+ is
a conjugate acid of base H2O.
It is interesting to observe the dual role
of water as an acid and a base. In case of
reaction with HCl water acts as a base while

The species: H2O, HCO3–, HSO4– and NH3 can
act both as Bronsted acids and bases. For
each case give the corresponding conjugate
acid and conjugate base.

The answer is given in the following Table:

6.10.3	Lewis Acids and Bases
G.N. Lewis in 1923 defined an acid as a
species which accepts electron pair and base
which donates an electron pair. As far as bases
are concerned, there is not much difference
between Brönsted-Lowry and Lewis concepts,
as the base provides a lone pair in both the
cases. However, in Lewis concept many
acids do not have proton. A typical example
is reaction of electron deficient species BF3
with NH3.
BF3 does not have a proton but still acts
as an acid and reacts with NH3 by accepting
its lone pair of electrons. The reaction can be
represented by,
BF3 + :NH3 → BF3:NH3
Electron deficient species like AlCl3, Co3+,
2+
Mg , etc. can act as Lewis acids while species
like H2O, NH3, OH– etc. which can donate a
pair of electrons, can act as Lewis bases.
Problem 6.15
Classify the following species into Lewis
acids and Lewis bases and show how these
act as such:
(a) HO –

(b) F –

(c) H+

(d) BCl3

Solution
(a)
(b)
(c)

(d)

Hydroxyl ion is a Lewis base as it can
donate an electron lone pair (:OH– ).
Flouride ion acts as a Lewis base
as it can donate any one of its four
electron lone pairs.
A proton is a Lewis acid as it can
accept a lone pair of electrons from
bases like hydroxyl ion and fluoride
ion.
BCl3 acts as a Lewis acid as it can
accept a lone pair of electrons from
species like ammonia or amine
molecules.

6.11	IONIZATION OF ACIDS AND BASES
Arrhenius concept of acids and bases
becomes useful in case of ionization of acids
and bases as mostly ionizations in chemical
and biological systems occur in aqueous
medium. Strong acids like perchloric acid

(HClO4), hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic
acid (HBr), hyrdoiodic acid (HI), nitric acid
(HNO3) and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) are termed
strong because they are almost completely
dissociated into their constituent ions in an
aqueous medium, thereby acting as proton
(H +) donors. Similarly, strong bases like
lithium hydroxide (LiOH), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), caesium
hydroxide (CsOH) and barium hydroxide
Ba(OH)2 are almost completely dissociated
into ions in an aqueous medium giving
hydroxyl ions, OH–. According to Arrhenius
concept they are strong acids and bases as
they are able to completely dissociate and
produce H3O+ and OH– ions respectively in
the medium. Alternatively, the strength of an
acid or base may also be gauged in terms of
Brönsted-Lowry concept of acids and bases,
wherein a strong acid means a good proton
donor and a strong base implies a good proton
acceptor. Consider, the acid-base dissociation
equilibrium of a weak acid HA,
HA(aq) + H2O(l)   H3O+(aq) + A–(aq)
conjugate conjugate
acid
base
acid
base
In section 6.10.2 we saw that acid (or
base) dissociation equilibrium is dynamic
involving a transfer of proton in forward and
reverse directions. Now, the question arises
that if the equilibrium is dynamic then with
passage of time which direction is favoured?
What is the driving force behind it? In order
to answer these questions we shall deal
into the issue of comparing the strengths
of the two acids (or bases) involved in the
dissociation equilibrium. Consider the two
acids HA and H 3O + present in the above
mentioned acid-dissociation equilibrium.
We have to see which amongst them is a
stronger proton donor. Whichever exceeds
in its tendency of donating a proton over the
other shall be termed as the stronger acid
and the equilibrium will shift in the direction
of weaker acid. Say, if HA is a stronger acid
than H3O+, then HA will donate protons and
not H3O+, and the solution will mainly contain
A– and H3O+ ions. The equilibrium moves in
the direction of formation of weaker acid

EQUILIBRIUM

193

and weaker base because the stronger acid
donates a proton to the stronger base.
It follows that as a strong acid dissociates
completely in water, the resulting base formed
would be very weak i.e., strong acids have
very weak conjugate bases. Strong acids
like perchloric acid (HClO4), hydrochloric acid
(HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid
(HI), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulphuric acid
(H2SO4) will give conjugate base ions ClO4–, Cl,
Br–, I–, NO3– and HSO4– , which are much weaker
bases than H2O. Similarly a very strong base
would give a very weak conjugate acid. On the
other hand, a weak acid say HA is only partially
dissociated in aqueous medium and thus, the
solution mainly contains undissociated HA
molecules. Typical weak acids are nitrous
acid (HNO2), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and acetic
acid (CH3COOH). It should be noted that the
weak acids have very strong conjugate bases.
For example, NH2–, O 2– and H – are very good
proton acceptors and thus, much stronger
bases than H2O.
Certain water soluble organic compounds
like phenolphthalein and bromothymol blue
behave as weak acids and exhibit different
colours in their acid (HIn) and conjugate base
(In– ) forms.

Such compounds are useful as indicators

6.11.1	The Ionization Constant of Water
and its Ionic Product
Some substances like water are unique in
their ability of acting both as an acid and a
base. We have seen this in case of water in
section 6.10.2. In presence of an acid, HA it
accepts a proton and acts as the base while
in the presence of a base, B– it acts as an
acid by donating a proton. In pure water, one
H2O molecule donates proton and acts as an
acid and another water molecules accepts a
proton and acts as a base at the same time.
The following equilibrium exists:

H3O+(aq) + OH–(aq)
H2O(l) + H2O(l)
acid
base
conjugate
conjugate
		
acid
base
The dissociation constant is represented by,
K = [H3O+] [OH–] / [H2O]

(6.26)

The concentration of water is omitted from
the denominator as water is a pure liquid and
its concentration remains constant. [H2O] is
incorporated within the equilibrium constant
to give a new constant, Kw, which is called the
ionic product of water.
Kw = [H+][OH–]			

(6.27)

The concentration of H has been found
out experimentally as 1.0 × 10–7 M at 298 K.
And, as dissociation of water produces equal
number of H+ and OH– ions, the concentration
of hydroxyl ions, [OH–] = [H+] = 1.0 × 10–7 M.
Thus, the value of Kw at 298K,
Kw = [H3O+][OH–] = (1 × 10–7)2 = 1 × 10–14 M2
+

(6.28)
The value of Kw is temperature dependent
as it is an equilibrium constant.
The density of pure water is 1000 g / L
and its molar mass is 18.0 g /mol. From this
the molarity of pure water can be given as,
[H2O] = (1000 g /L)(1 mol/18.0 g) = 55.55 M.
Therefore, the ratio of dissociated water to
that of undissociated water can be given as:
10 –7 / (55.55) = 1.8 × 10–9 or ~ 2 in 10–9 (thus,
equilibrium lies mainly towards undissociated
water)
We can distinguish acidic, neutral and
basic aqueous solutions by the relative values
of the H3O+ and OH– concentrations:
Acidic: [H3O+] > [OH– ]
Neutral: [H3O+] = [OH– ]
Basic : [H3O+] < [OH–]
6.11.2	The pH Scale
Hydronium ion concentration in molarity is
more conveniently expressed on a logarithmic
scale known as the pH scale. The pH of a
solution is defined as the negative logarithm

  of hydrogen

to base 10 of the activity a H

chemistry

ion. In dilute solutions (< 0.01 M), activity
of hydrogen ion (H+) is equal in magnitude
to molarity represented by [H+]. It should
be noted that activity has no units and is
defined as:
= [H+] / mol L–1
From the definition of pH, the following
can be written,
pH = – log aH+ = – log {[H+] / mol L–1}
Thus, an acidic solution of HCl (10–2 M)
will have a pH = 2. Similarly, a basic solution
of NaOH having [OH–] =10–4 M and [H3O+] =
10–10 M will have a pH = 10. At 25 °C, pure
water has a concentration of hydrogen ions,
[H + ] = 10–7 M. Hence, the pH of pure water is
given as:
pH = –log(10–7) = 7
Acidic solutions possess a concentration
of hydrogen ions, [H + ] > 10–7 M, while basic
solutions possess a concentration of hydrogen
ions, [H+] < 10–7 M. thus, we can summarise
that
Acidic solution has pH < 7
Basic solution has pH > 7
Neutral solution has pH = 7
Now again, consider the equation (6.28)
at 298 K
Kw = [H3O+] [OH–] = 10–14
Taking negative logarithm on both sides
of equation, we obtain
–log Kw = – log {[H3O+] [OH–]}
= – log [H3O+] – log [OH–]
= – log 10 –14
pKw = pH + pOH = 14
(6.29)
Note that although K w may change
with temperature the variations in pH with
temperature are so small that we often
ignore it.
pK w is a very important quantity for
aqueous solutions and controls the relative
concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxyl
ions as their product is a constant. It should
be noted that as the pH scale is logarithmic,
a change in pH by just one unit also means
change in [H+] by a factor of 10. Similarly,

when the hydrogen ion concentration, [H+]
changes by a factor of 100, the value of pH
changes by 2 units. Now you can realise why
the change in pH with temperature is often
ignored.
Measurement of pH of a solution is very
essential as its value should be known
when dealing with biological and cosmetic
applications. The pH of a solution can be
found roughly with the help of pH paper that
has different colour in solutions of different
pH. Now-a-days pH paper is available with
four strips on it. The different strips have
different colours (Fig. 6.11) at the same pH.
The pH in the range of 1-14 can be determined
with an accuracy of ~0.5 using pH paper.

Fig.6.11 pH-paper with four strips that may have
different colours at the same pH

For greater accuracy pH meters are used.
pH meter is a device that measures the
pH-dependent electrical potential of the test
solution within 0.001 precision. pH meters
of the size of a writing pen are now available
in the market. The pH of some very common
substances are given in Table 6.5 (page 195).
Problem 6.16
The concentration of hydrogen ion in a
sample of soft drink is 3.8 × 10–3M. what
is its pH ?
Solution
pH = – log[3.8 × 10–3]
= – {log[3.8] + log[10–3]}
= – {(0.58) + (– 3.0)} = – { – 2.42} = 2.42
Therefore, the pH of the soft drink is 2.42
and it can be inferred that it is acidic.

H3O+ concentration is generated (i) from
the ionization of HCl dissolved i.e.,
HCl(aq) + H2O(l)
H3O+ (aq) + Cl –(aq),
and (ii) from ionization of H2O. In these very
dilute solutions, both sources of H3O+ must
be considered:
[H3O+] = 10–8 + x
Kw = (10–8 + x)(x) = 10–14
or x2 + 10–8 x – 10–14 = 0
[OH – ] = x = 9.5 × 10–8
So, pOH = 7.02 and pH = 6.98
6.11.3 Ionization Constants of Weak Acids

Here, c = initial concentration of the
undissociated acid, HX at time, t = 0. α =
extent up to which HX is ionized into ions.
Using these notations, we can derive the

equilibrium constant for the above discussed
acid-dissociation equilibrium:
Ka = c2α2 / c(1-α) = cα2 / 1-α
Ka is called the dissociation or ionization
constant of acid HX. It can be represented
alternatively in terms of molar concentration
as follows,
(6.30)
Ka = [H+][X –] / [HX]
At a given temperature T, K a is a
measure of the strength of the acid HX i.e.,
larger the value of Ka, the stronger is the
acid. Ka is a dimensionless quantity with
the understanding that the standard state
concentration of all species is 1M.
The values of the ionization constants
of some selected weak acids are given in

quantities. Thus, we have:
pKa = –log (Ka)

(6.31)

Knowing the ionization constant, K a
of an acid and its initial concentration, c,
it is possible to calculate the equilibrium
concentration of all species and also the
degree of ionization of the acid and the pH of
the solution.
A general step-wise approach can be
adopted to evaluate the pH of the weak
electrolyte as follows:
Step 1. The species present before
dissociation are identified as Brönsted-Lowry
acids/bases.
Step 2. Balanced equations for all possible
reactions i.e., with a species acting both as
acid as well as base are written.
Step 3. The reaction with the higher Ka is
identified as the primary reaction whilst the
other is a subsidiary reaction.
Step 4. Enlist in a tabular form the following
values for each of the species in the primary
reaction
(a) Initial concentration, c.
(b)

Change in concentration on proceeding
to equilibrium in terms of α, degree of
ionization.

(c)

Equilibrium concentration.

Step 5. Substitute equilibrium concentrations
into equilibrium constant equation for
principal reaction and solve for α.
Step 6. Calculate the concentration of species
in principal reaction.
Step 7. Calculate pH = – log[H3O+]
The above mentioned methodology has
been elucidated in the following examples.
Problem 6.18
The ionization constant of HF is
3.2 × 10 –4 . Calculate the degree of
dissociation of HF in its 0.02 M solution.
Calculate the concentration of all species
present (H3O+, F – and HF) in the solution
and its pH.

Substituting equilibrium concentrations
in the equilibrium reaction for principal
reaction gives:
Ka = (0.02α)2 / (0.02 – 0.02α)
= 0.02 α2 / (1 –α) = 3.2 × 10–4
We obtain the following quadratic equation:
α2 + 1.6 × 10–2α – 1.6 × 10–2 = 0
The quadratic equation in α can be solved
and the two values of the roots are:
α = + 0.12 and – 0.12
The negative root is not acceptable and
hence,
α = 0.12
This means that the degree of ionization,
α = 0.12, then equilibrium concentrations
of other species viz., HF, F – and H3O+ are
given by:
[H3O+] = [F –] = cα = 0.02 × 0.12
= 2.4 × 10–3 M
[HF] = c(1 – α) = 0.02 (1 – 0.12)
= 17.6 × 10-3 M
pH = – log[H+] = –log(2.4 × 10–3) = 2.62
Problem 6.19
The pH of 0.1M monobasic acid is 4.50.
Calculate the concentration of species H+, A–

value of Ka and pKa of the monobasic acid.

pH = –log(1.41 × 10–3) = 2.85.

pH = – log [H+]
Therefore, [H+] = 10 –pH = 10 –4.50
= 3.16 × 10

6.11.4	Ionization of Weak Bases
The ionization of base MOH can be represented
by equation:
M+(aq) + OH–(aq)
MOH(aq)

–5

[H+] = [A–] = 3.16 × 10–5
Ka = [H+][A-] / [HA]

Thus,

[HA]eqlbm = 0.1 – (3.16 × 10-5)  0.1
Ka = (3.16 × 10–5)2 / 0.1 = 1.0 × 10–8
pKa = – log(10–8) = 8
Alternatively, “Percent dissociation” is
another useful method for measure of
strength of a weak acid and is given as:
Percent dissociation
= [HA]dissociated/[HA]initial × 100%
(6.32)
Problem 6.20
Calculate the pH of 0.08M solution of

[H+] = 1.41 × 10–3 M.

Therefore,

In a weak base there is partial ionization
of MOH into M+ and OH–, the case is similar
to that of acid-dissociation equilibrium. The
equilibrium constant for base ionization
is called base ionization constant and is
represented by Kb. It can be expressed in
terms of concentration in molarity of various
species in equilibrium by the following
equation:
(6.33)
Kb = [M+][OH–] / [MOH]		
Alternatively, if c = initial concentration
of base and α = degree of ionization of base
i.e. the extent to which the base ionizes.
When equilibrium is reached, the equilibrium
constant can be written as:
Kb = (cα)2 / c (1-α) = cα2 / (1-α)
The values of the ionization constants of
some selected weak bases, Kb are given in
Table 6.7.

nicotine all behave as very weak bases due to
their very small Kb. Ammonia produces OH– in
aqueous solution:

The pH scale for the hydrogen ion

= 5.98 × 10–5
The concentration of the corresponding
hydrazinium ion is also the same as that
of hydroxyl ion. The concentration of both
these ions is very small so the concentration
of the undissociated base can be taken
equal to 0.004M.
Thus,
Kb = [NH2NH3+][OH–] / [NH2NH2]
= (5.98 × 10–5)2 / 0.004 = 8.96 × 10–7
pKb = –logKb = –log(8.96 × 10–7) = 6.04.

From the pH we can calculate the hydrogen

of hydroxyl ions. Thus we have:

Therefore, [H+] = 1.12 × 10–9
pH = – log[H+] = 8.95.
6.11.5	Relation between Ka and Kb
As seen earlier in this chapter, Ka and Kb
represent the strength of an acid and a base,
respectively. In case of a conjugate acid-base
pair, they are related in a simple manner so
that if one is known, the other can be deduced.
Considering the example of NH4+ and NH3
we see,
H3O+(aq) + NH3(aq)
NH4+(aq) + H2O(l)
Ka = [H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+] = 5.6 × 10–10
NH3(aq) + H2O(l)
NH4+(aq) + OH–(aq)
–
+
Kb =[ NH4 ][ OH ] / NH3 = 1.8 × 10–5
Net: 2 H2O(l)
H3O+(aq) + OH –(aq)
Kw = [H3O+][ OH– ] = 1.0 × 10–14 M
Where, Ka represents the strength of NH4+
as an acid and Kb represents the strength of
NH3 as a base.

It can be seen from the net reaction that
the equilibrium constant is equal to the
product of equilibrium constants Ka and Kb
for the reactions added. Thus,
Ka × K b = {[H3O+][ NH3] / [NH4+ ]} × {[NH4+]
[OH–] / [NH3]}
= [H3O+][OH–] = Kw
= (5.6 ×10–10) × (1.8 × 10–5) = 1.0 × 10–14 M



Unit 6.indd 198

9/12/2022 11:58:28 AM

EQUILIBRIUM

199

This can be extended to make a
generalisation. The equilibrium constant
for a net reaction obtained after adding
two (or more) reactions equals the product
of the equilibrium constants for individual
reactions:
K NET = K1 × K2 × ……

(6.35)

Similarly, in case of a conjugate acid-base
pair,
Ka × Kb = Kw

(6.36)

Knowing one, the other can be obtained.
It should be noted that a strong acid will have
a weak conjugate base and vice-versa.
Alternatively, the above expression
K w = K a × K b , can also be obtained by
considering the base-dissociation equilibrium
reaction:
B(aq) + H2O(l)

BH+(aq) + OH–(aq)

K b = [BH+][OH–] / [B]

As the concentration of water remains
constant it has been omitted from the
denominator and incorporated within the
dissociation constant. Then multiplying and
dividing the above expression by [H+], we get:
Kb = [BH+][OH –][H+] / [B][H+]
={[ OH–][H+]}{[BH+] / [B][H+]}
= Kw / Ka
or Ka × Kb = Kw
It may be noted that if we take negative
logarithm of both sides of the equation, then
pK values of the conjugate acid and base are
related to each other by the equation:
pKa + pKb = pKw = 14 (at 298K)
Problem 6.23
Determine the degree of ionization and pH of
a 0.05M of ammonia solution. The ionization
constant of ammonia can be taken from
Table 6.7. Also, calculate the ionization
constant of the conjugate acid of ammonia.
Solution
The ionization of NH3 in water is represented
by equation:

NH3 + H2O
NH4+ + OH–
We use equation (6.33) to calculate
hydroxyl ion concentration,
[OH–] = c α = 0.05 α
Kb = 0.05 α2 / (1 – α)
The value of α is small, therefore the
quadratic equation can be simplified by
neglecting α in comparison to 1 in the
denominator on right hand side of the
equation,
Thus,
Kb = c α2 or α = √ (1.77 × 10–5 / 0.05)
= 0.018.
[OH ] = c α = 0.05 × 0.018 = 9.4 × 10–4M.
–

[H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 / (9.4 × 10–4)
= 1.06 × 10–11
pH = –log(1.06 × 10–11) = 10.97.
Now, using the relation for conjugate
acid-base pair,
Ka × Kb = Kw
using the value of K b of NH 3 from
Table 6.7.
We can determine the concentration of
conjugate acid NH4+
Ka = Kw / Kb = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5
= 5.64 × 10–10.
6.11.6 Di- and Polybasic Acids and Diand Polyacidic Bases
Some of the acids like oxalic acid, sulphuric
acid and phosphoric acids have more than
one ionizable proton per molecule of the
acid. Such acids are known as polybasic or
polyprotic acids.
The ionization reactions for example for
a dibasic acid H2X are represented by the
equations:
H+(aq) + HX–(aq)
H2X(aq)
HX–(aq)

H+(aq) + X2–(aq)

And the corresponding equilibrium
constants are given below:
Ka1= {[H+][HX–]} / [H2X] and



Unit 6.indd 199

9/12/2022 11:58:28 AM

200

chemistry

Ka2 = {[H+][X2-]} / [HX-]
Here, Ka1and Ka2are called the first and second
ionization constants respectively of the acid H2
X. Similarly, for tribasic acids like H3PO4 we
have three ionization constants. The values
of the ionization constants for some common
polyprotic acids are given in Table 6.8.
Table 6.8	The Ionization Constants of Some
Common Polyprotic Acids (298K)

In general, when strength of H-A bond
decreases, that is, the energy required to break
the bond decreases, HA becomes a stronger
acid. Also, when the H-A bond becomes more
polar i.e., the electronegativity difference
between the atoms H and A increases and
there is marked charge separation, cleavage
of the bond becomes easier thereby increasing
the acidity.
But it should be noted that while comparing
elements in the same group of the periodic
table, H-A bond strength is a more important
factor in determining acidity than its polar
nature. As the size of A increases down the
group, H-A bond strength decreases and so
the acid strength increases. For example,
Size increases

It can be seen that higher order ionization
constants (K a2, K a3) are smaller than the

lower order ionization constant (K a1) of a
polyprotic acid. The reason for this is that
it is more difficult to remove a positively
charged proton from a negative ion due to
electrostatic forces. This can be seen in the
case of removing a proton from the uncharged
H2CO3 as compared from a negatively charged
HCO3–. Similarly, it is more difficult to remove
a proton from a doubly charged HPO42– anion
as compared to H2PO4–.
Polyprotic acid solutions contain a
mixture of acids like H2A, HA– and A2– in case
of a diprotic acid. H2A being a strong acid, the
primary reaction involves the dissociation of
H2 A, and H3O+ in the solution comes mainly
from the first dissociation step.
6.11.7 Factors Affecting Acid Strength
Having discussed quantitatively the strengths
of acids and bases, we come to a stage where
we can calculate the pH of a given acid
solution. But, the curiosity rises about why
should some acids be stronger than others?
What factors are responsible for making
them stronger? The answer lies in its being a
complex phenomenon. But, broadly speaking
we can say that the extent of dissociation of
an acid depends on the strength and polarity
of the H-A bond.

HF << HCl << HBr << HI
Acid strength increases
Similarly, H2S is stronger acid than H2O.
But, when we discuss elements in the same
row of the periodic table, H-A bond polarity
becomes the deciding factor for determining
the acid strength. As the electronegativity
of A increases, the strength of the acid also
increases. For example,
Electronegativity of A increases
CH4 < NH3 < H2O < HF
Acid strength increases
6.11.8 Common Ion Effect in the
Ionization of Acids and Bases
Consider an example of acetic acid dissociation
equilibrium represented as:
CH3COOH(aq)
H+(aq) + CH3COO– (aq)
or HAc(aq)

H+ (aq) + Ac– (aq)

Ka = [H+][Ac– ] / [HAc]
Addition of acetate ions to an acetic
acid solution results in decreasing the
concentration of hydrogen ions, [H+]. Also,
if H+ ions are added from an external source
then the equilibrium moves in the direction
of undissociated acetic acid i.e., in a direction
of reducing the concentration of hydrogen
ions, [H+]. This phenomenon is an example



Unit 6.indd 200

9/12/2022 11:58:28 AM

EQUILIBRIUM

201

of common ion effect. It can be defined as
a shift in equilibrium on adding a substance
that provides more of an ionic species already
present in the dissociation equilibrium.
Thus, we can say that common ion effect is
a phenomenon based on the Le Chatelier’s
principle discussed in section 6.8.
In order to evaluate the pH of the solution
resulting on addition of 0.05M acetate ion to
0.05M acetic acid solution, we shall consider
the acetic acid dissociation equilibrium once
again,
H+(aq) + Ac–(aq)

Let x be the extent of ionization of acetic

0.05+x
Therefore,
Ka= [H+][Ac– ]/[H Ac] = {(0.05+x)(x)}/(0.05-x)
As Ka is small for a very weak acid, x<<0.05.
Hence, (0.05 + x) ≈ (0.05 – x) ≈ 0.05
Thus,
1.8 × 10–5 = (x) (0.05 + x) / (0.05 – x)
= x(0.05) / (0.05) = x = [H+] = 1.8 × 10–5M
pH = – log(1.8 × 10–5) = 4.74
Problem 6.24
Calculate the pH of a 0.10M ammonia
solution. Calculate the pH after 50.0 mL
of this solution is treated with 25.0 mL of
0.10M HCl. The dissociation constant of
ammonia, Kb = 1.77 × 10–5
Solution

Kb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH3] = 1.77 × 10–5
Before neutralization,
[NH4+] = [OH–] = x
[NH3] = 0.10 – x  0.10
x2 / 0.10 = 1.77 × 10–5

Thus, x = 1.33 × 10–3 = [OH–]
Therefore, [H+] = Kw / [OH–] = 10–14 /
(1.33 × 10–3) = 7.51 × 10–12
pH = –log (7.5 × 10–12) = 11.12
On addition of 25 mL of 0.1M HCl
solution (i.e., 2.5 mmol of HCl) to 50
mL of 0.1M ammonia solution (i.e., 5
mmol of NH3), 2.5 mmol of ammonia
molecules are neutralized. The resulting
75 mL solution contains the remaining
unneutralized 2.5 mmol of NH3 molecules
and 2.5 mmol of NH4+.

NH3 molecules. This NH3 exists in the

where, y = [OH ] = [NH4 ]
The final 75 mL solution after
neutralisation already contains
2.5 m mol NH4+ ions (i.e. 0.033M), thus
total concentration of NH4+ ions is given
as:
[NH4+] = 0.033 + y
As y is small, [NH4OH]  0.033 M and
[NH4+]  0.033M.
We know,
Kb = [NH4+][OH–] / [NH4OH]
= y (0.033)/(0.033) = 1.77 × 10–5 M
Thus, y = 1.77 × 10–5 = [OH–]
[H+] = 10–14 / 1.77 × 10–5 = 0.56 × 10–9
Hence, pH = 9.24
6.11.9 Hydrolysis of Salts and the pH of
their Solutions
Salts formed by the reactions between acids
and bases in definite proportions, undergo
ionization in water. The cations/anions

formed on ionization of salts either exist as
hydrated ions in aqueous solutions or interact
with water to reform corresponding acids/
bases depending upon the nature of salts.
The later process of interaction between
water and cations/anions or both of salts
is called hydrolysis. The pH of the solution
gets affected by this interaction. The cations
(e.g., Na+, K+, Ca2+, Ba2+, etc.) of strong bases
and anions (e.g., Cl–, Br–, NO3–, ClO4– etc.) of
strong acids simply get hydrated but do not
hydrolyse, and therefore the solutions of
salts formed from strong acids and bases are
neutral i.e., their pH is 7. However, the other
category of salts do undergo hydrolysis.

increased of H+ ion concentration in solution
making the solution acidic. Thus, the pH of
NH4Cl solution in water is less than 7.

We now consider the hydrolysis of the
salts of the following types :
(i)
salts of weak acid and strong base e.g.,
CH3COONa.
(ii) salts of strong acid and weak base e.g.,
NH4Cl, and
(iii) salts of weak acid and weak base, e.g.,
CH3COONH4.

Without going into detailed calculation,
it can be said that degree of hydrolysis is
independent of concentration of solution, and
pH of such solutions is determined by their
pK values:

In the first case, CH3COONa being a salt of
weak acid, CH3COOH and strong base, NaOH
gets completely ionised in aqueous solution.
CH3COONa(aq) → CH3COO– (aq)+ Na+(aq)
Acetate ion thus formed undergoes
hydrolysis in water to give acetic acid and
OH– ions
CH3COO–(aq)+H2O(l)

CH3COOH(aq)+OH–(aq)

Acetic acid being a weak acid
(Ka = 1.8 × 10–5) remains mainly unionised in
solution. This results in increase of OH– ion
concentration in solution making it alkaline.
The pH of such a solution is more than 7.
Similarly, NH 4 Cl formed from weak
base, NH4OH and strong acid, HCl, in water
dissociates completely.

NH4Cl(aq) → NH 4(aq) +Cl– (aq)
Ammonium ions undergo hydrolysis with
water to form NH4OH and H+ ions
+
NH 4 (aq) + H2O (1)
NH4OH(aq) + H+(aq)
Ammonium hydroxide is a weak base
(K b = 1.77 × 10 –5) and therefore remains
almost unionised in solution. This results in

Consider the hydrolysis of CH3COONH4
salt formed from weak acid and weak base.
The ions formed undergo hydrolysis as follow:

CH3COOH and NH4OH, also remain into

pH = 7 + ½ (pKa – pKb)

(6.38)

The pH of solution can be greater than 7,
if the difference is positive and it will be less
than 7, if the difference is negative.
Problem 6.25
The pKa of acetic acid and pKb of ammonium
hydroxide are 4.76 and 4.75 respectively.
Calculate the pH of ammonium acetate
solution.
Solution
pH = 7 + ½ [pKa – pKb]
= 7 + ½ [4.76 – 4.75]
= 7 + ½ [0.01] = 7 + 0.005 = 7.005
6.12 BUFFER SOLUTIONS
Many body fluids e.g., blood or urine have
definite pH and any deviation in their pH
indicates malfunctioning of the body. The
control of pH is also very important in
many chemical and biochemical processes.
Many medical and cosmetic formulations
require that these be kept and administered
at a particular pH. The solutions which
resist change in pH on dilution or with
the addition of small amounts of acid or
alkali are called Buffer Solutions. Buffer

solutions of known pH can be prepared from
the knowledge of pKa of the acid or pKb of base
and by controlling the ratio of the salt and acid
or salt and base. A mixture of acetic acid and
sodium acetate acts as buffer solution around
pH 4.75 and a mixture of ammonium chloride
and ammonium hydroxide acts as a buffer
around pH 9.25. You will learn more about
buffer solutions in higher classes.
6.12.1 Designing Buffer Solution
Knowledge of pK a , pK b and equilibrium
constant help us to prepare the buffer solution
of known pH. Let us see how we can do this.
Preparation of Acidic Buffer
To prepare a buffer of acidic pH we use weak
acid and its salt formed with strong base.
We develop the equation relating the pH, the
equilibrium constant, Ka of weak acid and
ratio of concentration of weak acid and its
conjugate base. For the general case where
the weak acid HA ionises in water,

Rearranging the expression we have,

acid present in the mixture. Since acid is a
weak acid, it ionises to a very little extent and
concentration of [HA] is negligibly different
from concentration of acid taken to form
buffer. Also, most of the conjugate base, [A—],
comes from the ionisation of salt of the acid.
Therefore, the concentration of conjugate
base will be negligibly different from the
concentration of salt. Thus, equation (6.40)
takes the form:
pH=pK a + log

[Salt]
[Acid]

In the equation (6.39), if the concentration
of [A—] is equal to the concentration of [HA],
then pH = pKa because value of log 1 is zero.
Thus if we take molar concentration of acid
and salt (conjugate base) same, the pH of the
buffer solution will be equal to the pKa of the
acid. So for preparing the buffer solution of
the required pH we select that acid whose pKa
is close to the required pH. For acetic acid
pKa value is 4.76, therefore pH of the buffer
solution formed by acetic acid and sodium
acetate taken in equal molar concentration
will be around 4.76.
A similar analysis of a buffer made with
a weak base and its conjugate acid leads to
the result,
[Conjugate acid,BH+ ]
pOH= pK b +log
[Base,B]
(6.41)
pH of the buffer solution can be calculated
by using the equation pH + pOH =14.
We know that pH + pOH = pK w and
pKa + pKb = pKw. On putting these values in
equation (6.41) it takes the form as follows:
pK w - pH = pK w  pK a  log

quantity

is the ratio of concentration

of conjugate base (anion) of the acid and the

pH = pK a + log

[Conjugate acid,BH+ ]
[Base,B]

(6.42)
If molar concentration of base and its
conjugate acid (cation) is same then pH of
the buffer solution will be same as pKa for the
base. pKa value for ammonia is s9.25; therefore
a buffer of pH close to 9.25 can be obtained
by taking ammonia solution and ammonium

For a buffer solution formed by ammonium
chloride and ammonium hydroxide, equation
(6.42) becomes:
[Conjugate acid,BH+ ]
pH = 9.25 + log
[Base,B]
pH of the buffer solution is not affected by
dilution because ratio under the logarithmic
term remains unchanged.
6.13 SOLUBILITY EQUILIBRIA OF
SPARINGLY SOLUBLE SALTS
We have already known that the solubility of
ionic solids in water varies a great deal. Some of
these (like calcium chloride) are so soluble that
they are hygroscopic in nature and even absorb
water vapour from atmosphere. Others (such
as lithium fluoride) have so little solubility
that they are commonly termed as insoluble.
The solubility depends on a number of factors
important amongst which are the lattice
enthalpy of the salt and the solvation enthalpy
of the ions in a solution. For a salt to dissolve
in a solvent the strong forces of attraction
between its ions (lattice enthalpy) must be
overcome by the ion-solvent interactions. The
solvation enthalpy of ions is referred to in
terms of solvation which is always negative i.e.
energy is released in the process of solvation.
The amount of solvation enthalpy depends on
the nature of the solvent. In case of a nonpolar (covalent) solvent, solvation enthalpy is
small and hence, not sufficient to overcome
lattice enthalpy of the salt. Consequently, the
salt does not dissolve in non-polar solvent. As
a general rule, for a salt to be able to dissolve
in a particular solvent its solvation enthalpy
must be greater than its lattice enthalpy so
that the latter may be overcome by former.
Each salt has its characteristic solubility which
depends on temperature. We classify salts on
the basis of their solubility in the following
three categories.
Category I

Soluble

Solubility > 0.1M

Category II

Slightly

0.01M<Solubility< 0.1M

Soluble

Category III Sparingly Solubility < 0.01M
Soluble

We shall now consider the equilibrium
between the sparingly soluble ionic salt and
its saturated aqueous solution.
6.13.1 Solubility Product Constant
Let us now have a solid like barium sulphate
in contact with its saturated aqueous solution.
The equilibrium between the undisolved solid
and the ions in a saturated solution can be
represented by the equation:
BaSO4(s) 

Ba2+(aq) + SO42–(aq),

The equilibrium constant is given by the
equation:
K = {[Ba2+][SO42–]} / [BaSO4]
For a pure solid substance the
concentration remains constant and we can
write
Ksp = K[BaSO4] = [Ba2+][SO42–]

(6.43)

We call Ksp the solubility product constant
or simply solubility product. The experimental
value of Ksp in above equation at 298K is
1.1 × 10–10. This means that for solid barium
sulphate in equilibrium with its saturated
solution, the product of the concentrations
of barium and sulphate ions is equal
to its solubility product constant. The
concentrations of the two ions will be equal to
the molar solubility of the barium sulphate.
If molar solubility is S, then
1.1 × 10–10 = (S)(S) = S2
or
S = 1.05 × 10–5.
Thus, molar solubility of barium sulphate
will be equal to 1.05 × 10–5 mol L–1.
A salt may give on dissociation two or
more than two anions and cations carrying
different charges. For example, consider a salt
like zirconium phosphate of molecular formula
(Zr4+)3(PO43–)4. It dissociates into 3 zirconium
cations of charge +4 and 4 phosphate
anions of charge –3. If the molar solubility of
zirconium phosphate is S, then it can be seen
from the stoichiometry of the compound that
[Zr4+] = 3S and [PO43–] = 4S
and Ksp = (3S)3 (4S)4 = 6912 (S)7
or S = {Ksp / (33 × 44)}1/7 = (Ksp / 6912)1/7

(where x × p = y × q–)
And its solubility product constant is

Ksp = [Mp+]x[Xq– ]y = (xS)x(yS)y

(6.44)

S(x + y) = Ksp / xx . yy
S = (Ksp / xx . yy)1 / x + y

(6.45)

The term Ksp in equation is given by Qsp
(section 6.6.2) when the concentration of one
or more species is not the concentration under
equilibrium. Obviously under equilibrium
conditions Ksp = Qsp but otherwise it gives the
direction of the processes of precipitation or
dissolution. The solubility product constants
of a number of common salts at 298K are
given in Table 6.9.
Problem 6.26
Calculate the solubility of A2 X3 in pure
water, assuming that neither kind of ion
reacts with water. The solubility product of
A2X3, Ksp = 1.1 × 10–23.
Solution
A2X3 → 2A3+ + 3X2–
Ksp = [A3+]2 [X2–]3 = 1.1 × 10–23
If S = solubility of A2X3, then
[A3+] = 2S; [X2–] = 3S
therefore, Ksp = (2S)2(3S)3 = 108S5
  = 1.1 × 10–23
thus, S5 = 1 × 10–25
S = 1.0 × 10–5 mol/L.
Problem 6.27

salts Ni(OH)2 and AgCN are 2.0 × 10–15 and
6 × 0–17 respectively. Which salt is more
soluble? Explain.

Ksp = [Ag+][CN–] = 6 × 10–17
Ni(OH)2
Ni2+ + 2OH–
2+
Ksp = [Ni ][OH–]2 = 2 × 10–15
Let [Ag+] = S1, then [CN-] = S1
Let [Ni2+] = S2, then [OH–] = 2S2
S12 = 6 × 10–17 , S1 = 7.8 × 10–9
(S2)(2S2)2 = 2 × 10–15, S2 = 0.58 × 10–4
Ni(OH)2 is more soluble than AgCN.

Dissolution of S mol/L of Ni(OH)2 provides
S mol/L of Ni2+ and 2S mol/L of OH–, but
the total concentration of OH– = (0.10 + 2S)
mol/L because the solution already contains
0.10 mol/L of OH– from NaOH.

6.13.2 Common Ion Effect on Solubility
of Ionic Salts
It is expected from Le Chatelier’s principle
that if we increase the concentration of any
one of the ions, it should combine with the
ion of its opposite charge and some of the
salt will be precipitated till once again Ksp =
Qsp. Similarly, if the concentration of one of
the ions is decreased, more salt will dissolve
to increase the concentration of both the ions
till once again Ksp = Qsp. This is applicable
even to soluble salts like sodium chloride
except that due to higher concentrations
of the ions, we use their activities instead
of their molarities in the expression for
Qsp. Thus if we take a saturated solution of
sodium chloride and pass HCl gas through it,
then sodium chloride is precipitated due to
increased concentration (activity) of chloride
ion available from the dissociation of HCl.
Sodium chloride thus obtained is of very
high purity and we can get rid of impurities
like sodium and magnesium sulphates. The
common ion effect is also used for almost
complete precipitation of a particular ion
as its sparingly soluble salt, with very low
value of solubility product for gravimetric
estimation. Thus we can precipitate silver ion
as silver chloride, ferric ion as its hydroxide
(or hydrated ferric oxide) and barium ion as
its sulphate for quantitative estimations.
Problem 6.28
Calculate the molar solubility of Ni(OH)2 in
0.10 M NaOH. The ionic product of Ni(OH)2
is 2.0 × 10–15.
Solution
Let the solubility of Ni(OH)2 be equal to S.

Ksp = 2.0 × 10–15 = [Ni2+] [OH–]2
= (S) (0.10 + 2S)2
As Ksp is small, 2S << 0.10,
thus, (0.10 + 2S) ≈ 0.10
Hence,
2.0 × 10–15 = S (0.10)2
S = 2.0 × 10–13 M = [Ni2+]
The solubility of salts of weak acids like
phosphates increases at lower pH. This is
because at lower pH the concentration of the
anion decreases due to its protonation. This
in turn increase the solubility of the salt so
that Ksp = Qsp. We have to satisfy two equilibria
simultaneously i.e.,
Ksp = [M+] [X–],

[X –] / [HX] = Ka/[H+]
Taking inverse of both side and adding 1
we get

HX   1  H   1
 X  

HX   H  
 X  

Ka

H   K a
  
Ka

Now, again taking inverse, we get
[X–] / {[X–] + [HX]} = f = Ka/(Ka + [H+]) and it
can be seen that ‘f’ decreases as pH decreases.
If S is the solubility of the salt at a given
pH then
Ksp = [S] [f S] = S2 {Ka/(Ka + [H+])} and
(6.46)
S = {Ksp ([H+] + Ka)/Ka}1/2 
Thus solubility S increases with increase
in [H+] or decrease in pH.

SUMMARY
When the number of molecules leaving the liquid to vapour equals the number of molecules
returning to the liquid from vapour, equilibrium is said to be attained and is dynamic in
nature. Equilibrium can be established for both physical and chemical processes and at
this stage rate of forward and reverse reactions are equal. Equilibrium constant, Kc is
expressed as the concentration of products divided by reactants, each term raised to the
stoichiometric coefficient.
For reaction, a A + b B
c C +d D
Kc = [C]c[D]d/[A]a[B]b
Equilibrium constant has constant value at a fixed temperature and at this stage all the
macroscopic properties such as concentration, pressure, etc. become constant. For a gaseous
reaction equilibrium constant is expressed as Kp and is written by replacing concentration
terms by partial pressures in Kc expression. The direction of reaction can be predicted by
reaction quotient Qc which is equal to Kc at equilibrium. Le Chatelier’s principle states that
the change in any factor such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. will cause the
equilibrium to shift in such a direction so as to reduce or counteract the effect of the change.
It can be used to study the effect of various factors such as temperature, concentration,
pressure, catalyst and inert gases on the direction of equilibrium and to control the yield of
products by controlling these factors. Catalyst does not effect the equilibrium composition
of a reaction mixture but increases the rate of chemical reaction by making available a new
lower energy pathway for conversion of reactants to products and vice-versa.
All substances that conduct electricity in aqueous solutions are called electrolytes. Acids,
bases and salts are electrolytes and the conduction of electricity by their aqueous solutions
is due to anions and cations produced by the dissociation or ionization of electrolytes
in aqueous solution. The strong electrolytes are completely dissociated. In weak electrolytes
there is equilibrium between the ions and the unionized electrolyte molecules. According to
Arrhenius, acids give hydrogen ions while bases produce hydroxyl ions in their aqueous
solutions. Brönsted-Lowry on the other hand, defined an acid as a proton donor and a base as
a proton acceptor. When a Brönsted-Lowry acid reacts with a base, it produces its conjugate
base and a conjugate acid corresponding to the base with which it reacts. Thus a conjugate
pair of acid-base differs only by one proton. Lewis further generalised the definition of an
acid as an electron pair acceptor and a base as an electron pair donor. The expressions
for ionization (equilibrium) constants of weak acids (Ka) and weak bases (Kb) are developed
using Arrhenius definition. The degree of ionization and its dependence on concentration and
common ion are discussed. The pH scale (pH = –log[H+]) for the hydrogen ion concentration
(activity) has been introduced and extended to other quantities (pOH = – log[OH–]); pKa = –log[Ka];
pKb = –log[Kb]; and pKw = –log[Kw] etc.). The ionization of water has been considered and we
note that the equation: pH + pOH = pKw is always satisfied. The salts of strong acid and
weak base, weak acid and strong base, and weak acid and weak base undergo hydrolysis in
aqueous solution. The definition of buffer solutions, and their importance are discussed
briefly. The solubility equilibrium of sparingly soluble salts is discussed and the equilibrium
constant is introduced as solubility product constant (Ksp). Its relationship with solubility
of the salt is established. The conditions of precipitation of the salt from their solutions
or their dissolution in water are worked out. The role of common ion and the solubility of
sparingly soluble salts is also discussed.
