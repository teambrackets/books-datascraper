GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR USING SYMBOLS FOR PHYSICAL QUANTITIES, CHEMICAL
ELEMENTS AND NUCLIDES
•
•
•
•

Symbols for physical quantities are normally single letters and printed in italic (or sloping) type.
However, in case of the two letter symbols, appearing as a factor in a product, some spacing is
necessary to separate this symbol from other symbols.
Abbreviations, i.e., shortened forms of names or expressions, such as p.e. for potential energy,
are not used in physical equations. These abbreviations in the text are written in ordinary
normal/roman (upright) type.
Vectors are printed in bold and normal/roman (upright) type. However, in class room situations,
vectors may be indicated by an arrow on the top of the symbol.
Multiplication or product of two physical quantities is written with some spacing between them.
Division of one physical quantity by another may be indicated with a horizontal bar or with



152

•
•

•

PHYSICS

solidus, a slash or a short oblique stroke mark (/) or by writing it as a product of the
numerator and the inverse first power of the denominator, using brackets at appropriate
places to clearly distinguish between the numerator and the denominator.
Symbols for chemical elements are written in normal/roman (upright) type. The symbol is
not followed by a full stop.
For example, Ca, C, H, He, U, etc.
The attached numerals specifying a nuclide are placed as a left subscript (atomic number)
and superscript (mass number).
For example, a U-235 nuclide is expressed as 235
(with 235 expressing the mass number
92 U
and 92 as the atomic number of uranium with chemical symbol U).
The right superscript position is used, if required, for indicating a state of ionisation (in
case of ions).
For example, Ca2+, PO34−

APPENDIX A 8
GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR USING SYMBOLS FOR SI UNITS, SOME OTHER UNITS, AND
SI PREFIXES
•

Symbols for units of physical quantities are printed/written in Normal/Roman (upright) type.

•

Standard and recommended symbols for units are written in lower case roman (upright)
type, starting with small letters. The shorter designations for units such as kg, m, s, cd,
etc., are symbols and not the abbreviations. The unit names are never capitalised. However,
the unit symbols are capitalised only if the symbol for a unit is derived from a proper name
of scientist, beginning with a capital, normal/roman letter.
For example, m for the unit ‘metre’, d for the unit ‘day’, atm for the unit ‘atmospheric
pressure’, Hz for the unit ‘hertz’, Wb for the unit ‘weber’, J for the unit ‘joule’, A for the unit
‘ampere’, V for the unit ‘volt’, etc. The single exception is L, which is the symbol for the
unit ‘litre’. This exception is made to avoid confusion of the lower case letter l with the
Arabic numeral l.

•

Symbols for units do not contain any final full stop at the end of recommended letter and
remain unaltered in the plural, using only singular form of the unit.
For example, for a length of 25 centimetres the unit symbol is written as 25 cm
and not 25 cms or 25 cm. or 25 cms., etc.

•

Use of solidus ( / ) is recommended only for indicating a division of one letter unit symbol by
another unit symbol. Not more than one solidus is used.
For example :
m/s2 or m s–2 (with a spacing between m and s–2) but not m/s/s;
1 Pl =1 N s m –2 = 1 N s/m2 = 1 kg/s m=1 kg m–1 s–1, but not 1 kg/m/s;
J/K mol or J K–1 mol–1, but not J/K/mol; etc.

•

Prefix symbols are printed in normal/roman (upright) type without spacing between the
prefix symbol and the unit symbol. Thus certain approved prefixes written very close to the
unit symbol are used to indicate decimal fractions or multiples of a SI unit, when it is
inconveniently small or large.
For example :
megawatt ( 1MW = 106 W);
nanosecond (1 ns = 10–9 s);
–2
centimetre (1 cm = 10 m);
picofarad (1 pF = 10–12 F);.
3
kilometre ( 1 km = 10 m);
microsecond (1µs = 10–6 s);
–3
millivolt (1 mV= 10 V);
gigahertz (1GHz = 109 Hz);



APPENDICES

153

kilowatt-hour (1 kW h = 103 W h = 3.6 MJ = 3.6 × 106 J);
microampere (1µ A = 10–6 A); micron (1µm = 10–6 m);
angstrom (1 Α° =0.1 nm = 10–10 m); etc.
The unit ‘micron’ which equals 10–6 m, i.e. a micrometre, is simply the name given to
convenient sub-multiple of the metre. In the same spirit, the unit ‘fermi’, equal to a
femtometre or 10–15 m has been used as the convenient length unit in nuclear studies.
Similarly, the unit ‘barn’, equal to 10–28 m2, is a convenient measure of cross-sectional
areas in sub-atomic particle collisions. However, the unit ‘micron’ is preferred over the
unit ‘micrometre’ to avoid confusion of the ‘micrometre’ with the length measuring
instrument called ‘micrometer’. These newly formed multiples or sub-multiples (cm, km,
µm, µs, ns) of SI units, metre and second, constitute a new composite inseparable symbol
for units.
•

When a prefix is placed before the symbol of a unit, the combination of prefix and symbol is
considered as a new symbol, for the unit, which can be raised to a positive or negative
power without using brackets. These can be combined with other unit symbols to form
compound unit. Rules for binding-in indices are not those of ordinary algebra.
For example :
cm3 means always (cm)3 = (0.01 m)3 = (10–2 m)3 = 10–6 m3, but never 0.01 m3 or
10–2 m3 or 1cm3 (prefix c with a spacing with m3 is meaningless as prefix c is to be attached
to a unit symbol and it has no physical significance or independent existence without
attachment with a unit symbol).
Similarly, mA2 means always (mA)2= (0.001A)2 = (10–3 A)2 =10–6 A2, but never 0.001 A2 or
10–3 A2 or m A2;
1 cm–1 = (10–2m)–1=102 m–1, but not 1c m–1 or 10–2 m–1;
1µs–1 means always (10–6s)–1=106 s–1, but not 1 × 10–6 s–1;
1 km2 means always (km)2 = (103 m)2=106 m2, but not 103 m2;
1mm2 means always (mm)2= (10–3 m)2=10–6 m2, but not 10–3 m2.

•

A prefix is never used alone. It is always attached to a unit symbol and written or fixed
before (pre-fix) the unit symbol.
For example :
103/m3 means 1000/m3 or 1000 m-3, but not k/m3 or k m-3.
106/m3 means 10,00,000/m3 or 10,00,000 m–3, but not M/m3 or M m–3

•

Prefix symbol is written very close to the unit symbol without spacing between them, while
unit symbols are written separately with spacing when units are multiplied together.
For example :
m s-1 (symbols m and s–1, in lower case, small letter m and s, are separate and independent
unit symbols for metre and second respectively, with spacing between them) means ‘metre
per second’, but not ‘milli per second’.
Similarly, ms–1 [symbol m and s are written very close to each other, with prefix symbol m
(for prefix milli) and unit symbol s, in lower case, small letter (for unit ‘second’) without
any spacing between them and making ms as a new composite unit] means ‘per millisecond’,
but never ‘metre per second’.
mS–1[symbol m and S are written very close to each other, with prefix symbol m (for prefix
milli) and unit symbol S, in capital roman letter S (for unit ‘siemens’) without any spacing
between them, and making mS as a new composite unit] means ‘per millisiemens’, but
never ‘per millisecond’.
C m [symbol C and m are written separately, representing unit symbols C (for unit ‘coulomb’)
and m (for unit ‘metre’), with spacing between them] means ‘coulomb metre’, but never
‘centimetre’, etc.

•

The use of double prefixes is avoided when single prefixes are available.
For example :



154

PHYSICS

10–9 m = 1nm (nanometre), but not 1mµm (millimicrometre),
10–6 m= 1µm (micron), but not 1mmm(millimillimetre),
10–12 F= 1 pF (picofarad), but not 1µµF (micromicrofarad),
109 W=1 GW (giga watt), but not 1 kMW (kilomegawatt), etc.
•

The use of a combination of unit and the symbols for units is avoided when the physical quantity
is expressed by combining two or more units.
For example :
joule per mole kelvin is written as J/mol K or J mol–1 K–1, but not joule/mole K or
J/ mol kelvin or J/mole K, etc.
joule per tesla is written as J/T or J T–1, but not joule /T or J per tesla or J/tesla, etc.
newton metre second is written as N m s, but not Newton m second or N m second or N metre s
or newton metre s, etc.
joule per kilogram kelvin is written as J/kg K or J kg–1 K–1, but not J/kilog K or joule/kg K or J/
kg kelvin or J/kilogram K, etc.

•

To simplify calculations, the prefix symbol is attached to the unit symbol in the numerator and
not to the denominator.
For example :
106 N/m2 is written more conveniently as MN/m2, in preference to N/mm2.
A preference has been expressed for multiples or sub-multiples involving the factor 1000, 10+3n
where n is the integer.

•

Proper care is needed when same symbols are used for physical quantities and units of physical
quantities.
For example :
The physical quantity weight (W) expressed as a product of mass (m) and acceleration due to
gravity (g) may be written in terms of symbols W, m and g printed in italic ( or sloping) type as W
= m g, preferably with a spacing between m and g. It should not be confused with the unit
symbols for the units watt (W), metre (m) and gram (g). However, in the equation W=m g, the
symbol W expresses the weight with a unit symbol J, m as the mass with a unit symbol kg and
g as the acceleration due to gravity with a unit symbol m/s2. Similarly, in equation F = m a, the
symbol F expresses the force with a unit symbol N, m as the mass with a unit symbol kg, and a
as the acceleration with a unit symbol m/s2. These symbols for physical quantities should not
be confused with the unit symbols for the units ‘farad’ (F), ‘metre’(m) and ‘are’ (a).
Proper distinction must be made while using the symbols h (prefix hecto, and unit hour), c
(prefix centi, and unit carat), d (prefix deci and unit day), T (prefix tera, and unit tesla), a (prefix
atto, and unit are), da (prefix deca, and unit deciare), etc.

•

SI base unit ‘kilogram’ for mass is formed by attaching SI prefix (a multiple equal to 103) ‘kilo’ to
a cgs (centimetre, gram, second) unit ‘gram’ and this may seem to result in an anomaly. Thus,
while a thousandth part of unit of length (metre) is called a millimetre (mm), a thousandth part
of the unit of mass (kg) is not called a millikilogram, but just a gram. This appears to give the
impression that the unit of mass is a gram (g) which is not true. Such a situation has arisen
because we are unable to replace the name ‘kilogram’ by any other suitable unit. Therefore, as
an exception, name of the multiples and sub-multiples of the unit of mass are formed by attaching
prefixes to the word ‘gram’ and not to the word ‘kilogram’.
For example :
103 kg =1 megagram ( 1Mg), but not 1 kilo kilogram (1 kkg);
10–6 kg = 1 milligram ( 1 mg), but not 1 microkilogram ( 1µkg);
10–3 kg = 1 gram (1g), but not 1 millikilogram (1 mkg), etc.

It may be emphasised again that you should use the internationally approved and recommended
symbols only. Continual practice of following general rules and guidelines in unit symbol writing
would make you learn mastering the correct use of SI units, prefixes and related symbols for physical
quantities in a proper perspective.

4.2

The only force in each case is the force of gravity, (neglecting effects of air) equal to
0.5 N vertically downward. The answers do not change, even if the motion of the pebble
is not along the vertical. The pebble is not at rest at the highest point. It has a constant
horizontal component of velocity throughout its motion.

x = u t + (½) a t2 = (10 × 25 – 10 × 625)m = – 6 km
First consider motion up to 30 s
x1 = 10 × 30 – 10 × 900 = – 8700 m
At t = 30 s, v = 10 – 20 × 30 = –590 m s-1
For motion from 30 s to 100 s :
x2 = – 590 × 70 = – 41300 m

t = 25 s :
t = 100 s :

x = x1 + x2 = – 50 km
4.11

(a) Velocity of car ( at t = 10 s ) = 0 + 2 × 10 = 20 m s–1
By the First Law, the horizontal component of velocity is 20 m s–1 throughout.
Vertical component of velocity (at t = 11s) = 0 + 10 × 1 = 10 m s–1
Velocity of stone (at t = 11s) = 20 2 + 10 2 = 500 = 22.4 m s – 1 at an angle of tan–1 ( ½) with
the horizontal.
(b)10 m s-2 vertically downwards.

4.12

(a) At the extreme position, the speed of the bob is zero. If the string is cut, it will fall
vertically downwards.
(b) At the mean position, the bob has a horizontal velocity. If the string is cut, it will fall
along a parabolic path.

4.13

The reading on the scale is a measure of the force on the floor by the man. By the Third
Law, this is equal and opposite to the normal force N on the man by the floor.
(a) N = 70 × 10 = 700 N ; Reading is 70 kg
(b) 70 × 10 – N = 70 × 5 ; Reading is 35 kg
(c) N – 70 × 10 = 70 × 5 ; Reading is 105 kg
(d)
70 × 10 – N = 70 × 10; Reading would be zero; the scale would read zero.
(a)
In all the three intervals, acceleration and, therefore, force are zero.
(b)
3 kg m s–1 at t = 0 ; (c) –3 kg m s–1 at t = 4 s.
If the 20 kg mass is pulled,
600 – T = 20 a, T = 10 a
a = 20 m s–2,
T = 200 N
If the 10 kg mass is pulled, a = 20 m s–2, T = 400 N
T – 8 × 10 = 8 a,
12 × 10 – T = 12a
i.e. a = 2 m s–2, T = 96 N
By momentum conservation principle, total final momentum is zero. Two momentum
vectors cannot sum to a null momentum unless they are equal and opposite.
Impulse on each ball = 0.05 ×12 = 0.6 kg m s-1 in magnitude. The two impulses are
opposite in direction.
Use momentum conservation : 100 v = 0.02 × 80

Alternative (b) is correct, according to the First Law

4.23

(a) The horse-cart system has no external force in empty space. The mutual forces
between the horse and the cart cancel (Third Law). On the ground, the contact force
between the system and the ground (friction) causes their motion from rest.
(b) Due to inertia of the body not directly in contact with the seat.
(c) A lawn mower is pulled or pushed by applying force at an angle. When you push, the
normal force (N ) must be more than its weight, for equilibrium in the vertical direction.
This results in greater friction f ( f ∝ N ) and, therefore, a greater applied force to move.
Just the opposite happens while pulling.
(d) To reduce the rate of change of momentum and hence to reduce the force necessary
to stop the ball.

Yes, momentum of the molecule + wall system is conserved. The wall has a recoil
momentum such that the momentum of the wall + momentum of the outgoing molecule
equals momentum of the incoming molecule, assuming the wall to be stationary initially.
However, the recoil momentum produces negligible velocity because of the large mass of
the wall. Since kinetic energy is also conserved, the collision is elastic.

FOREWORD
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s life
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system
and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and
textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic
idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp
boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us
significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined
in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers
will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue
imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and
freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed
on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination
is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.
Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as
participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change is school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to
teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address
the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at
different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher
priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in
small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this
book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science
and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,
Professor A.W. Joshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals
for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring
Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,
Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor
Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution.
As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in
the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will
enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

RATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOKS
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content
load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises
reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential
learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCER T has
undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes.
Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have
been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the
following:
•

Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in
the same class

•

Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same
subject

•

Difficulty level

•

Content, which is easily accessible to students without much
interventions from teachers and can be learned by children through
self-learning or peer-learning

•

Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out
the changes given above.

PREFACE
More than a decade ago, based on National Policy of Education (NPE-1986),
National Council of Educational Research and Training published physics
textbooks for Classes XI and XII, prepared under the chairmanship of
Professor T. V. Ramakrishnan, F.R.S., with the help of a team of learned co-authors.
The books were well received by the teachers and students alike. The books, in
fact, proved to be milestones and trend-setters. However, the development of
textbooks, particularly science books, is a dynamic process in view of the changing
perceptions, needs, feedback and the experiences of the students, educators and
the society. Another version of the physics books, which was the result of the
revised syllabus based on National Curriculum Framework for School Education-2000
(NCFSE-2000), was brought out under the guidance of Professor Suresh Chandra,
which continued up to now. Recently the NCERT brought out the National Curriculum
Framework-2005 (NCF-2005), and the syllabus was accordingly revised during a
curriculum renewal process at school level. The higher secondary stage syllabus
(NCERT, 2005) has been developed accordingly. The Class XI textbook contains
fifteen chapters in two parts. Part I contains first eight chapters while Part II contains
next seven chapters. This book is the result of the renewed efforts of the present
Textbook Development Team with the hope that the students will appreciate the
beauty and logic of physics. The students may or may not continue to study physics
beyond the higher secondary stage, but we feel that they will find the thought
process of physics useful in any other branch they may like to pursue, be it finance,
administration, social sciences, environment, engineering, technology, biology or
medicine. For those who pursue physics beyond this stage, the matter developed
in these books will certainly provide a sound base.
Physics is basic to the understanding of almost all the branches of science and
technology. It is interesting to note that the ideas and concepts of physics are
increasingly being used in other branches such as economics and commerce, and
behavioural sciences too. We are conscious of the fact that some of the underlying
simple basic physics principles are often conceptually quite intricate. In this book,
we have tried to bring in a conceptual coherence. The pedagogy and the use of
easily understandable language are at the core of our effort without sacrificing the
rigour of the subject. The nature of the subject of physics is such that a certain
minimum use of mathematics is a must. We have tried to develop the mathematical
formulations in a logical fashion, as far as possible.
Students and teachers of physics must realise that physics is a branch which
needs to be understood, not necessarily memorised. As one goes from secondary to
higher secondary stage and beyond, physics involves mainly four components,
(a) large amount of mathematical base, (b) technical words and terms, whose
normal English meanings could be quite different, (c) new intricate concepts,
and (d) experimental foundation. Physics needs mathematics because we wish
to develop objective description of the world around us and express our observations
in terms of measurable quantities. Physics discovers new properties of particles
and wants to create a name for each one. The words are picked up normally from
common English or Latin or Greek, but gives entirely different meanings to these
words. It would be illuminating to look up words like energy, force, power, charge,
spin, and several others, in any standard English dictionary, and compare their



CK

CK

x
meanings with their physics meanings. Physics develops intricate and often weirdlooking concepts to explain the behaviour of particles. Finally, it must be
remembered that entire physics is based on observations and experiments, without
which a theory does not get acceptance into the domain of physics.
This book has some features which, we earnestly hope, will enhance its
usefulness for the students. Each chapter is provided with a Summary at its end
for a quick overview of the contents of the chapter. This is followed by Points to
Ponder which points out the likely misconceptions arising in the minds of students,
hidden implications of certain statements/principles given in the chapter and
cautions needed in applying the knowledge gained from the chapter. They also
raise some thought-provoking questions which would make a student think about
life beyond physics. Students will find it interesting to think and apply their mind
on these points. Further, a large number of solved examples are included in the
text in order to clarify the concepts and/or to illustrate the application of these
concepts in everyday real-life situations. Occasionally, historical perspective has
been included to share the excitement of sequential development of the subject of
physics. Some Boxed items are introduced in many chapters either for this purpose
or to highlight some special features of the contents requiring additional attention
of the learners. Finally, a Subject Index has been added at the end of the book for
ease in locating keywords in the book.
The special nature of physics demands, apart from conceptual understanding,
the knowledge of certain conventions, basic mathematical tools, numerical values
of important physical constants, and systems of measurement units covering a
vast range from microscopic to galactic levels. In order to equip the students, we
have included the necessary tools and database in the form of Appendices A-1 to
A-9 at the end of the book. There are also some other appendices at the end of
some chapters giving additional information or applications of matter discussed in
that chapter.
Special attention has been paid for providing illustrative figures. To increase
the clarity, the figures are drawn in two colours. A large number of Exercises are
given at the end of each chapter. Some of these are from real-life situations. Students
are urged to solve these and in doing so, they may find them very educative. Moreover,
some Additional Exercises are given which are more challenging. Answers and
hints to solve some of these are also included. In the entire book, SI units have been
used. A comprehensive account of ‘units and measurement’ is given in Chapter 2 as a
part of prescribed syllabus/curriculum as well as a help in their pursuit of physics.
A box-item in this chapter brings out the difficulty in measuring as simple a thing as
the length of a long curved line. Tables of SI base units and other related units are
given here merely to indicate the presently accepted definitions and to indicate the
high degree of accuracy with which measurements are possible today. The numbers
given here are not to be memorised or asked in examinations.
There is a perception among students, teachers, as well as the general public
that there is a steep gradient between secondary and higher secondary stages.
But a little thought shows that it is bound to be there in the present scenario of
education. Education up to secondary stage is general education where a student
has to learn several subjects – sciences, social sciences, mathematics, languages,
at an elementary level. Education at the higher secondary stage and beyond, borders
on acquiring professional competence, in some chosen fields of endeavour. You
may like to compare this with the following situation. Children play cricket or
badminton in lanes and small spaces outside (or inside) their homes. But then



CK

CK

some of them want to make it to the school team, then district team, then State
team and then the National team. At every stage, there is bound to be a steep
gradient. Hard work would have to be put in whether students want to pursue
their education in the area of sciences, humanities, languages, music, fine arts,
commerce, finance, architecture, or if they want to become sportspersons or fashion
designers.
Completing this book has only been possible because of the spontaneous
and continuous support of many people. The Textbook Development Team is
thankful to Dr. V. H. Raybagkar for allowing us to use his box item in Chapter
4 and to Dr. F. I. Surve for allowing us to use two of his box items in Chapter 15.
We express also our gratitude to the Director, NCERT, for entrusting us with
the task of preparing this textbook as a part of national effort for improving
science education. The Head, Department of Education in Science and
Mathematics, NCERT, was always willing to help us in our endeavour in every
possible way.
The previous text got excellent academic inputs from teachers, students and
experts who sincerely suggested improvement during the past few years. We are
thankful to all those who conveyed these inputs to NCERT. We are also thankful to
the members of the Review Workshop and Editing Workshop organised to discuss
and refine the first draft. We thank the Chairmen and their teams of authors for
the text written by them in 1988, which provided the base and reference for
developing the 2002 version as well as the present version of the textbook.
Occasionally, substantial portions from the earlier versions, particularly those
appreciated by students/teachers, have been adopted/adapted and retained in
the present book for the benefit of coming generation of learners.
We welcome suggestions and comments from our valued users, especially
students and teachers. We wish our young readers a happy journey to the exciting
realm of physics.

A NOTE FOR THE TEACHERS
To make the curriculum learner -centred, students should be made to participate and interact
in the learning process directly. Once a week or one out of every six classes would be a good
periodicity for such seminars and mutual interaction. Some suggestions for making the discussion
participatory are given below, with reference to some specific topics in this book.
Students may be divided into groups of five to six. The membership of these groups may be
rotated during the year, if felt necessary.
The topic for discussion can be presented on the board or on slips of paper. Students should
be asked to write their reactions or answers to questions, whichever is asked, on the given
sheets. They should then discuss in their groups and add modifications or comments in those
sheets. These should be discussed either in the same or in a different class. The sheets may also
be evaluated.
We suggest here three possible topics from the book. The first two topics suggested are, in
fact, very general and refer to the development of science over the past four centuries or more.
Students and teachers may think of more such topics for each seminar.
1. Ideas that changed civilisation
Suppose human beings are becoming extinct. A message has to be left for future generations or
alien visitors. Eminent physicist R P Feynmann wanted the following message left for future
beings, if any.
“Matter is made up of atoms”
A lady student and teacher of literature, wanted the following message left:
“Water existed, so human beings could happen”.
Another person thought it should be: “Idea of wheel for motion”
Write down what message each one of you would like to leave for future generations. Then
discuss it in your group and add or modify, if you want to change your mind. Give it to your
teacher and join in any discussion that follows.
2. Reductionism
Kinetic Theory of Gases relates the Big to the Small, the Macro to the Micro. A gas as a system
is related to its components, the molecules. This way of describing a system as a result of the
properties of its components is usually called Reductionism. It explains the behaviour of the
group by the simpler and predictable behaviour of individuals. Macroscopic observations and
microscopic properties have a mutual interdependence in this approach. Is this method useful?
This way of understanding has its limitations outside physics and chemistry, may be even
in these subjects. A painting cannot be discussed as a collection of the properties of chemicals
used in making the canvas and the painting. What emerges is more than the sum of its
components.
Question: Can you think of other areas where such an approach is used?
Describe briefly a system which is fully describable in terms of its components. Describe
one which is not. Discuss with other members of the group and write your views. Give it to your
teacher and join in any discussion that may follow.
3. Molecular approach to heat
Describe what you think will happen in the following case. An enclosure is separated by a
porous wall into two parts. One is filled with nitrogen gas (N2) and the other with CO2. Gases
will diffuse from one side to the other.
Question 1: Will both gases diffuse to the same extent? If not, which will diffuse more. Give
reasons.
Question 2: Will the pressure and temperature be unchanged? If not, what will be the changes
in both. Give reasons.
Write down your answers. Discuss with the group and modify them or add comments.
Give to the teacher and join in the discussion.
Students and teachers will find that such seminars and discussions lead to tremendous
understanding, not only of physics, but also of science and social sciences. They also bring in
some maturity among students.

nature’s four fundamental forces. A mystery
surrounding the strong nuclear force has been
solved. The three quarks within the proton can
sometimes appear to be free, although no free

Measurement of any physical quantity involves comparison
with a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen, internationally
accepted reference standard called unit. The result of a
measurement of a physical quantity is expressed by a
number (or numerical measure) accompanied by a unit.
Although the number of physical quantities appears to be
very large, we need only a limited number of units for
expressing all the physical quantities, since they are interrelated with one another. The units for the fundamental or
base quantities are called fundamental or base units. The
units of all other physical quantities can be expressed as
combinations of the base units. Such units obtained for the
derived quantities are called derived units. A complete set
of these units, both the base units and derived units, is
known as the system of units.
1.2 THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM OF UNITS
In earlier time scientists of different countries were using
different systems of units for measurement. Three such
systems, the CGS, the FPS (or British) system and the MKS
system were in use extensively till recently.
The base units for length, mass and time in these systems
were as follows :
• In CGS system they were centimetre, gram and second
respectively.
• In FPS system they were foot, pound and second
respectively.
• In MKS system they were metre, kilogram and second
respectively.
The system of units which is at present internationally
accepted for measurement is the Système Internationale
d’ Unites (French for International System of Units),
abbreviated as SI. The SI, with standard scheme of symbols,
units and abbreviations, developed by the Bureau
International des Poids et measures (The International
Bureau of Weights and Measures, BIPM) in 1971 were
recently revised by the General Conference on Weights and
Measures in November 2018. The scheme is now for



2

PHYSICS

international usage in scientific, technical, industrial
and commercial work. Because SI units used decimal
system, conversions within the system are quite simple
and convenient. We shall follow the SI units in
this book.
In SI, there are seven base units as given in
Table 1.1. Besides the seven base units, there are two
more units that are defined for (a) plane angle dθ as the
ratio of length of arc ds to the radius r and (b) solid
angle dΩ as the ratio of the intercepted area dA of the
spherical surface, described about the apex O as the
centre, to the square of its radius r, as shown in
Fig. 1.1(a) and (b) respectively. The unit for plane angle
is radian with the symbol rad and the unit for the solid
angle is steradian with the symbol sr. Both these are
dimensionless quantities.

m

The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum c to be 299792458
when expressed in the unit m s–1 , where the second is defined in terms of
the caesium frequency ∆ν cs.

Mass

kilogram

kg

The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the Planck constant h to be 6.62607015×10–34 when
expressed in the unit J s, which is equal to kg m2 s–1, where the metre and
the second are defined in terms of c and ∆ν cs.

Time

second

s

The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed
numerical value of the caesium frequency ∆ν cs, the unperturbed groundstate hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium-133 atom, to be
9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s–1.

Electric

ampere

A

The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by
taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be
1.602176634×10–19 when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s,
where the second is defined in terms of ∆ν cs.

Thermo

Temperature

kelvin

K

The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature.
It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant
k to be 1.380649×10–23 when expressed in the unit J K–1, which is equal to
kg m2 s–2 k–1, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of
h, c and ∆ν cs.

Amount of
substance

mole

mol

The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole
contains exactly 6.02214076×1023 elementary entities. This number is the
fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, NA, when expressed in the
unit mol–1 and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance,
symbol n, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary
entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron,
any other particle or specified group of particles.

Luminous
intensity

candela

cd

The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in given direction.
It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of
monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×1012 Hz, Kcd, to be 683 when expressed
in the unit lm W–1, which is equal to cd sr W–1, or cd sr kg–1m–2s3, where the
kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of h, c and ∆ν cs.

The values mentioned here need not be remembered or asked in a test. They are given here only to indicate the
extent of accuracy to which they are measured. With progress in technology, the measuring techniques get
improved leading to measurements with greater precision. The definitions of base units are revised to keep up
with this progress.

Some units retained for general use (Though outside SI)

Note that when mole is used, the elementary
entities must be specified. These entities
may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons,
other particles or specified groups of such
particles.
We employ units for some physical quantities
that can be derived from the seven base units
(Appendix A 6). Some derived units in terms of
the SI base units are given in (Appendix A 6.1).
Some SI derived units are given special names
(Appendix A 6.2 ) and some derived SI units make
use of these units with special names and the
seven base units (Appendix A 6.3). These are
given in Appendix A 6.2 and A 6.3 for your ready
reference. Other units retained for general use
are given in Table 1.2.
Common SI prefixes and symbols for multiples
and sub-multiples are given in Appendix A2.
General guidelines for using symbols for physical
quantities, chemical elements and nuclides are
given in Appendix A7 and those for SI units and
some other units are given in Appendix A8 for
your guidance and ready reference.
1.3

SIGNIFICANT FIGURES

As discussed above, every measurement
involves errors. Thus, the result of
measurement should be reported in a way that
indicates the precision of measurement.
Normally, the reported result of measurement
is a number that includes all digits in the
number that are known reliably plus the first
digit that is uncertain. The reliable digits plus

the first uncertain digit are known as
significant digits or significant figures. If we
say the period of oscillation of a simple
pendulum is 1.62 s, the digits 1 and 6 are
reliable and certain, while the digit 2 is
uncertain. Thus, the measured value has three
significant figures. The length of an object
reported after measurement to be 287.5 cm has
four significant figures, the digits 2, 8, 7 are
certain while the digit 5 is uncertain. Clearly,
reporting the result of measurement that
includes more digits than the significant digits
is superfluous and also misleading since it
would give a wrong idea about the precision of
measurement.
The rules for determining the number of
significant figures can be understood from the
following examples. Significant figures
indicate, as already mentioned, the precision
of measurement which depends on the least
count of the measuring instrument. A choice
of change of different units does not
change the number of significant digits or
figures in a measurement. This important
remark makes most of the following
observations clear:
(1) For example, the length 2.308 cm has four
significant figures. But in different units, the
same value can be written as 0.02308 m or 23.08
mm or 23080 µm.
All these numbers have the same number of
significant figures (digits 2, 3, 0, 8), namely four.



4

PHYSICS

This shows that the location of decimal point is
of no consequence in determining the number
of significant figures.
The example gives the following rules :

•
•

All the non-zero digits are significant.

•

If the number is less than 1, the zero(s)
on the right of decimal point but to the
left of the first non-zero digit are not
significant. [In 0.00 2308, the underlined
zeroes are not significant].

•

The terminal or trailing zero(s) in a
number without a decimal point are not
significant.

All the zeros between two non-zero digits
are significant, no matter where the
decimal point is, if at all.

[Thus 123 m = 12300 cm = 123000 mm has
three significant figures, the trailing zero(s)
being not significant.] However, you can also
see the next observation.

•

The trailing zero(s) in a number with a
decimal point are significant.
[The numbers 3.500 or 0.06900 have four
significant figures each.]

(2) There can be some confusion regarding the
trailing zero(s). Suppose a length is reported to
be 4.700 m. It is evident that the zeroes here
are meant to convey the precision of
measurement and are, therefore, significant. [If
these were not, it would be superfluous to write
them explicitly, the reported measurement
would have been simply 4.7 m]. Now suppose
we change units, then
4.700 m = 470.0 cm = 4700 mm = 0.004700 km
Since the last number has trailing zero(s) in a
number with no decimal, we would conclude
erroneously from observation (1) above that the
number has two significant figures, while in
fact, it has four significant figures and a mere
change of units cannot change the number of
significant figures.
(3) To remove such ambiguities in
determining the number of significant
figures, the best way is to report every
measurement in scientific notation (in the
power of 10). In this notation, every number is
expressed as a × 10b, where a is a number
between 1 and 10, and b is any positive or

negative exponent (or power) of 10. In order to
get an approximate idea of the number, we may
round off the number a to 1 (for a ≤ 5) and to 10
(for 5<a ≤ 10). Then the number can be
expressed approximately as 10b in which the
exponent (or power) b of 10 is called order of
magnitude of the physical quantity. When only
an estimate is required, the quantity is of the
order of 10b. For example, the diameter of the
earth (1.28×107m) is of the order of 107m with
the order of magnitude 7. The diameter of
hydrogen atom (1.06 ×10–10m) is of the order of
10 –10 m, with the order of magnitude
–10. Thus, the diameter of the earth is 17 orders
of magnitude larger than the hydrogen atom.
It is often customary to write the decimal after
the first digit. Now the confusion mentioned in
(a) above disappears :
4.700 m = 4.700 × 102 cm
= 4.700 × 103 mm = 4.700 × 10–3 km
The power of 10 is irrelevant to the
determination of significant figures. However, all
zeroes appearing in the base number in the
scientific notation are significant. Each number
in this case has four significant figures.
Thus, in the scientific notation, no confusion
arises about the trailing zero(s) in the base
number a. They are always significant.
(4) The scientific notation is ideal for reporting
measurement. But if this is not adopted, we use
the rules adopted in the preceding example :
• For a number greater than 1, without any
decimal, the trailing zero(s) are not
significant.
• For a number with a decimal, the trailing
zero(s) are significant.
(5) The digit 0 conventionally put on the left of a
decimal for a number less than 1 (like 0.1250)
is never significant. However, the zeroes at the
end of such number are significant in a

1.3.1 Rules for Arithmetic Operations with
Significant Figures
The result of a calculation involving approximate
measured values of quantities (i.e. values with
limited number of significant figures) must
reflect the uncertainties in the original
measured values. It cannot be more accurate
than the original measured values themselves
on which the result is based. In general, the
final result should not have more significant
figures than the original data from which it was
obtained. Thus, if mass of an object is measured
to be, say, 4.237 g (four significant figures) and
its volume is measured to be 2.51 cm3, then its
density, by mere arithmetic division, is
1.68804780876 g/cm3 upto 11 decimal places.
It would be clearly absurd and irrelevant to
record the calculated value of density to such a
precision when the measurements on which the
value is based, have much less precision. The
following rules for arithmetic operations with
significant figures ensure that the final result
of a calculation is shown with the precision that
is consistent with the precision of the input
measured values :
(1) In multiplication or division, the final
result should retain as many significant
figures as are there in the original number
with the least significant figures.
Thus, in the example above, density should
be reported to three significant figures.
Density =

4.237g

2.51 cm

3

= 1.69 g cm

-3

Similarly, if the speed of light is given as
3.00 × 108 m s-1 (three significant figure) and
one year (1y = 365.25 d) has 3.1557 × 107 s (five
significant figures), the light year is 9.47 × 1015 m
(three significant figures).
(2) In addition or subtraction, the final result
should retain as many decimal places as are
there in the number with the least
decimal places.
For example, the sum of the numbers
436.32 g, 227.2 g and 0.301 g by mere arithmetic
addition, is 663.821 g. But the least precise
measurement (227.2 g) is correct to only one

decimal place. The final result should, therefore,
be rounded off to 663.8 g.
Similarly, the difference in length can be
expressed as :
0.307 m – 0.304 m = 0.003 m = 3 ×10–3 m.
Note that we should not use the rule (1) applicable
for multiplication and division and write 664 g as
the result in the example of addition and
3.00 × 10–3 m in the example of subtraction. They
do not convey the precision of measurement
properly. For addition and subtraction, the rule
is in terms of decimal places.
1.3.2 Rounding off the Uncertain Digits
The result of computation with approximate
numbers, which contain more than one
uncertain digit, should be rounded off. The rules
for rounding off numbers to the appropriate
significant figures are obvious in most cases. A
number 2.746 rounded off to three significant
figures is 1.75, while the number 1.743 would
be 1.74. The rule by convention is that the
preceding digit is raised by 1 if the
insignificant digit to be dropped (the
underlined digit in this case) is more than
5, and is left unchanged if the latter is less
than 5. But what if the number is 2.745 in
which the insignificant digit is 5. Here, the
convention is that if the preceding digit is
even, the insignificant digit is simply
dropped and, if it is odd, the preceding digit
is raised by 1. Then, the number 2.745 rounded
off to three significant figures becomes 1.74. On
the other hand, the number 2.735 rounded off
to three significant figures becomes 1.74 since
the preceding digit is odd.
In any involved or complex multi-step
calculation, you should retain, in intermediate
steps, one digit more than the significant digits
and round off to proper significant figures at the
end of the calculation. Similarly, a number
known to be within many significant figures,
such as in 1.99792458 × 108 m/s for the speed
of light in vacuum, is rounded off to an
approximate value 3 × 108 m/s , which is often
employed in computations. Finally, remember
that exact numbers that appear in formulae like
2 π in T = 2π



L
g

, have a large (infinite) number

6

PHYSICS

of significant figures. The value of π =
3.1415926.... is known to a large number of
significant figures. You may take the value as
3.142 or 3.14 for π, with limited number of
significant figures as required in specific
cases.

Example 1.1 Each side of a cube is
measured to be 7.203 m. What are the
total surface area and the volume of the
cube to appropriate significant figures?

= 16.2 cm ± 0.6 %.
Similarly, the breadth b may be written as
b = 10.1 ± 0.1 cm
= 10.1 cm ± 1 %
Then, the error of the product of two (or more)
experimental values, using the combination of
errors rule, will be
l b = 163.62 cm2 + 1.6%

⊳

= 163.62 + 2.6 cm2

Answer The number of significant figures in
the measured length is 4. The calculated area
and the volume should therefore be rounded off
to 4 significant figures.
Surface area of the cube = 6(7.203)2 m2
= 311.299254 m2
= (7.203)3 m3
= 373.714754 m3
⊳

= 373.7 m3

Example 1.2 5.74 g of a substance
occupies 1.2 cm3. Express its density by
keeping the significant figures in view.

⊳

Answer There are 3 significant figures in the
measured mass whereas there are only 2
significant figures in the measured volume.
Hence the density should be expressed to only
2 significant figures.

5.74
g cm−3
1.2
= 4.8 g cm--3 .

Here 3 cm2 is the uncertainty or error in the
estimation of area of rectangular sheet.

However, if data are subtracted, the number of
significant figures can be reduced.
For example, 12.9 g – 7.06 g, both specified to
three significant figures, cannot properly be
evaluated as 5.84 g but only as 5.8 g, as
uncertainties in subtraction or addition combine
in a different fashion (smallest number of
decimal places rather than the number of
significant figures in any of the number added
or subtracted).
(3) The relative error of a value of number
specified to significant figures depends not
only on n but also on the number itself.

Density =

1.3.3 Rules for Determining the Uncertainty
in the Results of Arithmetic
Calculations
The rules for determining the uncertainty or
error in the number/measured quantity in
arithmetic operations can be understood from
the following examples.
(1) If the length and breadth of a thin
rectangular sheet are measured, using a metre
scale as 16.2 cm and, 10.1 cm respectively, there
are three significant figures in each
measurement. It means that the length l may
be written as
l = 16.2 ± 0.1 cm

l b = 164 + 3 cm2

(2) If a set of experimental data is specified
to n significant figures, a result obtained by
combining the data will also be valid to n
significant figures.

= 311.3 m2
Volume of the cube

This leads us to quote the final result as

For example, the accuracy in measurement of
mass 1.02 g is ± 0.01 g whereas another
measurement 9.89 g is also accurate to ± 0.01 g.
The relative error in 1.02 g is
= (± 0.01/1.02) × 100 %
= ± 1%
Similarly, the relative error in 9.89 g is
= (± 0.01/9.89) × 100 %
= ± 0.1 %
Finally, remember that intermediate results in
a multi-step computation should be
calculated to one more significant figure in
every measurement than the number of
digits in the least precise measurement.
These should be justified by the data and then
the arithmetic operations may be carried out;



UNITS AND MEASUREMENT

7

otherwise rounding errors can build up. For
example, the reciprocal of 9.58, calculated (after
rounding off) to the same number of significant
figures (three) is 0.104, but the reciprocal of
0.104 calculated to three significant figures is
9.62. However, if we had written 1/9.58 = 0.1044
and then taken the reciprocal to three significant
figures, we would have retrieved the original
value of 9.58.
This example justifies the idea to retain one
more extra digit (than the number of digits in
the least precise measurement) in intermediate
steps of the complex multi-step calculations in
order to avoid additional errors in the process
of rounding off the numbers.
1.4 DIMENSIONS OF PHYSICAL QUANTITIES
The nature of a physical quantity is described
by its dimensions. All the physical quantities
represented by derived units can be expressed
in terms of some combination of seven
fundamental or base quantities. We shall call
these base quantities as the seven dimensions
of the physical world, which are denoted with
square brackets [ ]. Thus, length has the
dimension [L], mass [M], time [T], electric current
[A], thermodynamic temperature [K], luminous
intensity [cd], and amount of substance [mol].
The dimensions of a physical quantity are the
powers (or exponents) to which the base
quantities are raised to represent that
quantity. Note that using the square brackets
[ ] round a quantity means that we are dealing
with ‘the dimensions of’ the quantity.
In mechanics, all the physical quantities can
be written in terms of the dimensions [L], [M]
and [T]. For example, the volume occupied by
an object is expressed as the product of length,
breadth and height, or three lengths. Hence the
dimensions of volume are [L] × [L] × [L] = [L]3 = [L3].
As the volume is independent of mass and time,
it is said to possess zero dimension in mass [M°],
zero dimension in time [T°] and three
dimensions in length.
Similarly, force, as the product of mass and
acceleration, can be expressed as
Force = mass × acceleration
= mass × (length)/(time)2
The dimensions of force are [M] [L]/[T]2 =
[M L T–2]. Thus, the force has one dimension in

mass, one dimension in length, and –2
dimensions in time. The dimensions in all other
base quantities are zero.
Note that in this type of representation, the
magnitudes are not considered. It is the quality
of the type of the physical quantity that enters.
Thus, a change in velocity, initial velocity,
average velocity, final velocity, and speed are
all equivalent in this context. Since all these
quantities can be expressed as length/time,
their dimensions are [L]/[T] or [L T–1].
1.5 DIMENSIONAL FORMULAE
DIMENSIONAL EQUATIONS

AND

The expression which shows how and which of
the base quantities represent the dimensions
of a physical quantity is called the dimensional
formula of the given physical quantity. For
example, the dimensional formula of the volume
is [M° L3 T°], and that of speed or velocity is
[M° L T-1]. Similarly, [M° L T–2] is the dimensional
formula of acceleration and [M L–3 T°] that of
mass density.
An equation obtained by equating a physical
quantity with its dimensional formula is called
the dimensional equation of the physical
quantity. Thus, the dimensional equations are
the equations, which represent the dimensions
of a physical quantity in terms of the base
quantities. For example, the dimensional
equations of volume [V ], speed [v], force [F ] and
mass density [ρ] may be expressed as
[V] = [M0 L3 T0]
[v] = [M0 L T–1]
[F] = [M L T–2]
[ρ] = [M L–3 T0]
The dimensional equation can be obtained
from the equation representing the relations
between the physical quantities. The
dimensional formulae of a large number and
wide variety of physical quantities, derived from
the equations representing the relationships
among other physical quantities and expressed
in terms of base quantities are given in
Appendix 9 for your guidance and ready
reference.

APPLICATIONS

1.6.1

Checking
the
Dimensional
Consistency of Equations

The magnitudes of physical quantities may be
added together or subtracted from one another
only if they have the same dimensions. In other
words, we can add or subtract similar physical
quantities. Thus, velocity cannot be added to
force, or an electric current cannot be subtracted
from the thermodynamic temperature. This
simple principle called the principle of
homogeneity of dimensions in an equation is
extremely useful in checking the correctness of
an equation. If the dimensions of all the terms
are not same, the equation is wrong. Hence, if
we derive an expression for the length (or
distance) of an object, regardless of the symbols
appearing in the original mathematical relation,
when all the individual dimensions are
simplified, the remaining dimension must be
that of length. Similarly, if we derive an equation
of speed, the dimensions on both the sides of
equation, when simplified, must be of length/
time, or [L T–1].
Dimensions are customarily used as a
preliminary test of the consistency of an
equation, when there is some doubt about the
correctness of the equation. However, the
dimensional consistency does not guarantee
correct equations. It is uncertain to the extent
of dimensionless quantities or functions. The
arguments of special functions, such as the
trigonometric, logarithmic and exponential
functions must be dimensionless. A pure
number, ratio of similar physical quantities,

such as angle as the ratio (length/length),
refractive index as the ratio (speed of light in
vacuum/speed of light in medium) etc., has no
dimensions.
Now we can test the dimensional consistency
or homogeneity of the equation

x = x 0 + v0 t + (1/2) a t 2
for the distance x travelled by a particle or body
in time t which starts from the position x0 with
an initial velocity v0 at time t = 0 and has uniform
acceleration a along the direction of motion.
The dimensions of each term may be written as
[x] = [L]
[x0 ] = [L]
[v0 t] = [L T–1] [T]
= [L]
[(1/2) a t2] = [L T–2] [T2]
= [L]
As each term on the right hand side of this
equation has the same dimension, namely that
of length, which is same as the dimension of
left hand side of the equation, hence this
equation is a dimensionally correct equation.
It may be noted that a test of consistency of
dimensions tells us no more and no less than a
test of consistency of units, but has the
advantage that we need not commit ourselves
to a particular choice of units, and we need not
worry about conversions among multiples and
sub-multiples of the units. It may be borne in
mind that if an equation fails this consistency
test, it is proved wrong, but if it passes, it is
not proved right. Thus, a dimensionally correct
equation need not be actually an exact
(correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong
(incorrect) or inconsistent equation must be
wrong.
⊳

quantities can be added or subtracted which
have the same dimensions. A thorough
understanding of dimensional analysis helps us
in deducing certain relations among different
physical quantities and checking the derivation,
accuracy and dimensional consistency or
homogeneity of various mathematical
expressions. When magnitudes of two or more
physical quantities are multiplied, their units
should be treated in the same manner as
ordinary algebraic symbols. We can cancel
identical units in the numerator and
denominator. The same is true for dimensions
of a physical quantity. Similarly, physical
quantities represented by symbols on both sides
of a mathematical equation must have the same
dimensions.

Example 1.3 Let us consider an equation

1
m v2 = m g h
2
where m is the mass of the body, v its
velocity, g is the acceleration due to
gravity and h is the height. Check
whether this equation is dimensionally
correct.
Answer The dimensions of LHS are
[M] [L T–1 ]2 = [M] [ L2 T–2]
= [M L2 T–2]



UNITS AND MEASUREMENT

9

The dimensions of RHS are
[M][L T–2] [L] = [M][L2 T–2]
= [M L2 T–2]
The dimensions of LHS and RHS are the same and
hence the equation is dimensionally correct. ⊳

Example 1.4 The SI unit of energy is
J = kg m2 s–2; that of speed v is m s–1 and
of acceleration a is m s–2. Which of the
formulae for kinetic energy (K) given below
can you rule out on the basis of
dimensional arguments (m stands for the
mass of the body) :
(a) K = m2 v3
(b) K = (1/2)mv2
(c) K = ma
(d) K = (3/16)mv2

Answer The dependence of time period T on
the quantities l, g and m as a product may be
written as :
T = k lx gy mz
where k is dimensionless constant and x, y
and z are the exponents.
By considering dimensions on both sides, we
have
[Lo M o T 1 ]=[L1 ]x [L1 T –2 ]y [M1 ]z

⊳

(e) K = (1/2)mv2 + ma

Answer Every correct formula or equation must
have the same dimensions on both sides of the
equation. Also, only quantities with the same
physical dimensions can be added or
subtracted. The dimensions of the quantity on
the right side are [M2 L3 T–3] for (a); [M L2 T–2] for
(b) and (d); [M L T–2] for (c). The quantity on the
right side of (e) has no proper dimensions since
two quantities of different dimensions have been
added. Since the kinetic energy K has the
dimensions of [M L2 T–2], formulas (a), (c) and (e)
are ruled out. Note that dimensional arguments
cannot tell which of the two, (b) or (d), is the
correct formula. For this, one must turn to the
actual definition of kinetic energy (see
Chapter 5). The correct formula for kinetic
energy is given by (b).

1.6.2

Deducing Relation among the
Physical Quantities

The method of dimensions can sometimes be
used to deduce relation among the physical
quantities. For this we should know the
dependence of the physical quantity on other
quantities (upto three physical quantities or
linearly independent variables) and consider it
as a product type of the dependence. Let us take
an example.

Example 1.5 Consider a simple
pendulum, having a bob attached to a

string, that oscillates under the action of
the force of gravity. Suppose that the period
of oscillation of the simple pendulum
depends on its length (l), mass of the bob
(m) and acceleration due to gravity (g).
Derive the expression for its time period
using method of dimensions.

= Lx+y T–2y Mz
On equating the dimensions on both sides,
we have
x + y = 0; –2y = 1; and z = 0

Then, T = k l g

Note that value of constant k can not be obtained
by the method of dimensions. Here it does not
matter if some number multiplies the right side
of this formula, because that does not affect its
dimensions.
Actually, k = 2π so that T = 2π

⊳

Dimensional analysis is very useful in deducing
relations among the interdependent physical
quantities. However, dimensionless constants
cannot be obtained by this method. The method
of dimensions can only test the dimensional
validity, but not the exact relationship between
physical quantities in any equation. It does not
distinguish between the physical quantities
having same dimensions.
A number of exercises at the end of this
chapter will help you develop skill in
dimensional analysis.

SUMMARY
1.

Physics is a quantitative science, based on measurement of physical quantities. Certain
physical quantities have been chosen as fundamental or base quantities (such as
length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance,
and luminous intensity).
2. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a certain basic, arbitrarily chosen but properly
standardised reference standard called unit (such as metre, kilogram, second, ampere,
kelvin, mole and candela). The units for the fundamental or base quantities are called
fundamental or base units.
3. Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a
combination of the base units and are called derived units. A complete set of units,
both fundamental and derived, is called a system of units.
4. The International System of Units (SI) based on seven base units is at present
internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world.
5. The SI units are used in all physical measurements, for both the base quantities and
the derived quantities obtained from them. Certain derived units are expressed by
means of SI units with special names (such as joule, newton, watt, etc).
6. The SI units have well defined and internationally accepted unit symbols (such as m
for metre, kg for kilogram, s for second, A for ampere, N for newton etc.).
7. Physical measurements are usually expressed for small and large quantities in scientific
notation, with powers of 10. Scientific notation and the prefixes are used to simplify
measurement notation and numerical computation, giving indication to the precision
of the numbers.
8. Certain general rules and guidelines must be followed for using notations for physical
quantities and standard symbols for SI units, some other units and SI prefixes for
expressing properly the physical quantities and measurements.
9. In computing any physical quantity, the units for derived quantities involved in the
relationship(s) are treated as though they were algebraic quantities till the desired
units are obtained.
10. In measured and computed quantities proper significant figures only should be retained.
Rules for determining the number of significant figures, carrying out arithmetic
operations with them, and ‘rounding off ‘ the uncertain digits must be followed.
11. The dimensions of base quantities and combination of these dimensions describe
the nature of physical quantities. Dimensional analysis can be used to check the
dimensional consistency of equations, deducing relations among the physical
quantities, etc. A dimensionally consistent equation need not be actually an
exact (correct) equation, but a dimensionally wrong or inconsistent equation
must be wrong.

moving train, the nearby trees, houses etc. seem to move rapidly in a direction opposite
to the train’s motion, but the distant objects (hill tops, the Moon, the stars etc.)
seem to be stationary. (In fact, since you are aware that you are moving, these
distant objects seem to move with you).

10 7 K, and its outer surface at a temperature of about 6000 K. At these high
temperatures, no substance remains in a solid or liquid phase. In what range do you
expect the mass density of the Sun to be, in the range of densities of solids and
liquids or gases ? Check if your guess is correct from the following data : mass of the

Motion is common to everything in the universe. We walk,
run and ride a bicycle. Even when we are sleeping, air moves
into and out of our lungs and blood flows in arteries and
veins. We see leaves falling from trees and water flowing
down a dam. Automobiles and planes carry people from one
place to the other. The earth rotates once every twenty-four
hours and revolves round the sun once in a year. The sun
itself is in motion in the Milky Way, which is again moving
within its local group of galaxies.
Motion is change in position of an object with time. How
does the position change with time ? In this chapter, we shall
learn how to describe motion. For this, we develop the
concepts of velocity and acceleration. We shall confine
ourselves to the study of motion of objects along a straight
line, also known as rectilinear motion. For the case of
rectilinear motion with uniform acceleration, a set of simple
equations can be obtained. Finally, to understand the relative
nature of motion, we introduce the concept of relative velocity.
In our discussions, we shall treat the objects in motion as
point objects. This approximation is valid so far as the size
of the object is much smaller than the distance it moves in a
reasonable duration of time. In a good number of situations
in real-life, the size of objects can be neglected and they can
be considered as point-like objects without much error.
In Kinematics, we study ways to describe motion without
going into the causes of motion. What causes motion
described in this chapter and the next chapter forms the
subject matter of Chapter 4.

PHYSICS

2.2 INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY AND SPEED
The average velocity tells us how fast an object
has been moving over a given time interval but
does not tell us how fast it moves at different
instants of time during that interval. For this,
we define instantaneous velocity or simply
velocity v at an instant t.
The velocity at an instant is defined as the
limit of the average velocity as the time interval
∆t becomes infinitesimally small. In other words,
v =

lim

∆x

(2.1a)

∆ t → 0 ∆t

=

dx

(2.1b)

dt
lim

where the symbol ∆t →0 stands for the operation
of taking limit as ∆tg0 of the quantity on its
right. In the language of calculus, the quantity
on the right hand side of Eq. (2.1a) is the
differential coefficient of x with respect to t and
dx

is denoted by

dt

(see Appendix 2.1). It is the

rate of change of position with respect to time,
at that instant.
We can use Eq. (2.1a) for obtaining the
value of velocity at an instant either
graphically or numerically. Suppose that we
want to obtain graphically the value of
velocity at time t = 4 s (point P) for the motion
of the car represented in Fig.2.1 calculation.
Let us take ∆t = 2 s centred at t = 4 s. Then,
by the definition of the average velocity, the
slope of line P1P2 ( Fig. 2.1) gives the value of
average velocity over the interval 3 s to 5 s.

Fig. 2.1 Determining velocity from position-time
graph. Velocity at t = 4 s is the slope of the
tangent to the graph at that instant.

Now, we decrease the value of ∆t from 2 s to 1
s. Then line P1P2 becomes Q1Q2 and its slope
gives the value of the average velocity over
the interval 3.5 s to 4.5 s. In the limit ∆t → 0,
the line P1P2 becomes tangent to the positiontime curve at the point P and the velocity at t
= 4 s is given by the slope of the tangent at
that point. It is difficult to show this
process graphically. But if we use
numerical method to obtain the value of
the velocity, the meaning of the limiting
process becomes clear. For the graph shown
in Fig. 2.1, x = 0.08 t3. Table 2.1 gives the
value of ∆x/∆t calculated for ∆t equal to 2.0 s,
1.0 s, 0.5 s, 0.1 s and 0.01 s centred at t =
4.0 s. The second and third columns give the

corresponding values of x, i.e. x (t1) = 0.08 t1

and x (t2) = 0.08 t 23 . The sixth column lists the
difference ∆x = x (t 2) – x (t1 ) and the last
column gives the ratio of ∆x and ∆t, i.e. the
average velocity corresponding to the value
of ∆t listed in the first column.
We see from Table 2.1 that as we decrease
the value of ∆t from 2.0 s to 0.010 s, the value of
the average velocity approaches the limiting
value 3.84 m s–1 which is the value of velocity at
dx
at t = 4.0 s. In this
dt
manner, we can calculate velocity at each
instant for motion of the car.
The graphical method for the determination
of the instantaneous velocity is always not a
convenient method. For this, we must carefully
plot the position–time graph and calculate the
value of average velocity as ∆t becomes smaller
and smaller. It is easier to calculate the value
of velocity at different instants if we have data
of positions at different instants or exact
expression for the position as a function of time.
Then, we calculate ∆x/∆t from the data for
decreasing the value of ∆t and find the limiting
value as we have done in Table 2.1 or use
differential calculus for the given expression and

t = 4.0 s, i.e. the value of

Note that for uniform motion, velocity is
the same as the average velocity at all
instants.
Instantaneous speed or simply speed is the
magnitude of velocity. For example, a velocity of
+ 24.0 m s–1 and a velocity of – 24.0 m s–1 —
both have an associated speed of 24.0 m s-1. It
should be noted that though average speed over
a finite interval of time is greater or equal to the
magnitude of the average velocity,
instantaneous speed at an instant is equal to
the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity at
that instant. Why so ?
2.3 ACCELERATION
The velocity of an object, in general, changes
during its course of motion. How to describe
this change? Should it be described as the rate
of change in velocity with distance or with
time ? This was a problem even in Galileo’s
time. It was first thought that this change could
be described by the rate of change of velocity
with distance. But, through his studies of
motion of freely falling objects and motion of
objects on an inclined plane, Galileo concluded
that the rate of change of velocity with time is
a constant of motion for all objects in free fall.
On the other hand, the change in velocity with
distance is not constant – it decreases with the
increasing distance of fall. This led to the
concept of acceleration as the rate of change
of velocity with time.
The average acceleration a over a time interval
is defined as the change of velocity divided by
the time interval :
a = v 2 – v1 = ∆v
t 2 – t1
∆t

Answer In notation of differential calculus, the
velocity is
v=

a + 16b – a – 4b
= 6.0 × b
2.0

(2.2)

where v2 and v1 are the instantaneous velocities
or simply velocities at time t2 and t1 . It is the
average change of velocity per unit time. The SI
unit of acceleration is m s–2 .
On a plot of velocity versus time, the average
acceleration is the slope of the straight line
connecting the points corresponding to (v2, t2)
and (v1, t1).



16

PHYSICS

Instantaneous acceleration is defined in the
same way as the instantaneous velocity :
∆v dv
=
(2.3)
∆t
dt
The acceleration at an instant is the slope
of the tangent to the v–t curve at that
instant.
Since velocity is a quantity having both
magnitude and direction, a change in
velocity may involve either or both of these
factors. Acceleration, therefore, may result
from a change in speed (magnitude), a
change in direction or changes in both. Like
velocity, acceleration can also be positive,
negative or zero. Position-time graphs for
motion with positive, negative and zero
acceleration are shown in Figs. 2.4 (a), (b)
and (c), respectively. Note that the graph
curves upward for positive acceleration;
downward for negative acceleration and it is
a straight line for zero acceleration.
Although acceleration can vary with time,
our study in this chapter will be restricted
to motion with constant acceleration. In this
case, the average acceleration equals the
constant value of acceleration during the
interval. If the velocity of an object is v o at t
= 0 and v at time t, we have

(c) An object is moving in negative direction
with a negative acceleration.
(d) An object is moving in positive direction
till time t1, and then turns back with the
same negative acceleration.

or, v = v0 + a t

An interesting feature of a velocity-time
graph for any moving object is that the area
under the curve represents the
displacement over a given time interval. A
general proof of this statement requires use of
calculus. We can, however, see that it is true
for the simple case of an object moving with
constant velocity u. Its velocity-time graph is
as shown in Fig. 2.4.

Let us see how velocity-time graph looks like
for some simple cases. Fig. 2.3 shows velocitytime graph for motion with constant acceleration
for the following cases :

with a positive acceleration.
(b) An object is moving in positive direction
with a negative acceleration.

Fig. 2.4 Area under v–t curve equals displacement
of the object over a given time interval.

The v-t curve is a straight line parallel to the
time axis and the area under it between t = 0
and t = T is the area of the rectangle of height u
and base T. Therefore, area = u × T = uT which
is the displacement in this time interval. How
come in this case an area is equal to a distance?
Think! Note the dimensions of quantities on
the two coordinate axes, and you will arrive at
the answer.
Note that the x-t, v-t, and a-t graphs shown
in several figures in this chapter have sharp
kinks at some points implying that the
functions are not differentiable at these
points. In any realistic situation, the
functions will be differentiable at all points
and the graphs will be smooth.
What this means physically is that
acceleration and velocity cannot change
values abruptly at an instant. Changes are
always continuous.
2.4 KINEMATIC
EQU ATIONS
FOR
UNIFORMLY ACCELERATED MOTION
For uniformly accelerated motion, we can derive
some simple equations that relate displacement
(x), time taken (t), initial velocity (v 0), final
velocity (v) and acceleration (a). Equation (2.4)
already obtained gives a relation between final
and initial velocities v and v0 of an object moving
with uniform acceleration a :
v = v0 + at

(2.4)

This relation is graphically represented in Fig. 2.5.

The set of Eq. (2.9a) were obtained by
assuming that at t = 0, the position of the particle,
x is 0. We can obtain a more general equation if
we take the position coordinate at t = 0 as nonzero, say x0. Then Eqs. (2.9a) are modified
(replacing x by x – x0 ) to :

0 = 25 +20 t + (½) (-10) t2
Or,

5t2 – 20t – 25 = 0

Solving this quadratic equation for t, we get
t = 5s
Note that the second method is better since we
do not have to worry about the path of the motion
as the motion is under constant acceleration.
⊳
⊳
Fig. 2.6

FIRST METHOD : In the first method, we split
the path in two parts : the upward motion (A to
B) and the downward motion (B to C) and
calculate the corresponding time taken t1 and
t2. Since the velocity at B is zero, we have :
v = vo + at
0 = 20 – 10t1
Or,
t1 = 2 s
This is the time in going from A to B. From B, or
the point of the maximum height, the ball falls
freely under the acceleration due to gravity. The
ball is moving in negative y direction. We use
equation

We have, y0 = 45 m, y = 0, v0 = 0, a = – g = –10 m s–2
0 = 45 + (½) (–10) t22
y = y0 + v 0t +

Solving, we get t2 = 3 s
Therefore, the total time taken by the ball before
it hits the ground = t1 + t2 = 2 s + 3 s = 5 s.

Example 2.4 Free-fall : Discuss the
motion of an object under free fall. Neglect
air resistance.

Answer An object released near the surface of
the Earth is accelerated downward under the
influence of the force of gravity. The magnitude
of acceleration due to gravity is represented by
g. If air resistance is neglected, the object is
said to be in free fall. If the height through
which the object falls is small compared to the
earth’s radius, g can be taken to be constant,
equal to 9.8 m s–2. Free fall is thus a case of
motion with uniform acceleration.
We assume that the motion is in y-direction,
more correctly in –y-direction because we
choose upward direction as positive. Since the
acceleration due to gravity is always downward,
it is in the negative direction and we have
a = – g = – 9.8 m s–2
The object is released from rest at y = 0. Therefore,
v0 = 0 and the equations of motion become:
v= 0–gt

y = 0 – ½ g t = –4.9 t

v2 = 0 – 2 g y = –19.6 y m2 s–2

distance travelled as a function of time and also
the variation of velocity with distance. The
variation of acceleration, velocity, and distance,
with time have been plotted in Fig. 2.7(a), (b)
and (c).

SECOND METHOD : The total time taken can
also be calculated by noting the coordinates of
initial and final positions of the ball with respect
to the origin chosen and using equation

the positions in the unit of yo. The fourth

to make quantitative studies of free fall.

Example 2.6 Stopping distance of
vehicles : When brakes are applied to a
moving vehicle, the distance it travels before
stopping is called stopping distance. It is
an important factor for road safety and
depends on the initial velocity (v0) and the
braking capacity, or deceleration, –a that
is caused by the braking. Derive an
expression for stopping distance of a vehicle
in terms of vo and a.

Answer Let the distance travelled by the vehicle
before it stops be ds. Then, using equation of
motion v2 = vo2 + 2 ax, and noting that v = 0, we
have the stopping distance
– v02
2a
Thus, the stopping distance is proportional to
the square of the initial velocity. Doubling the
ds =

initial velocity increases the stopping distance
by a factor of 4 (for the same deceleration).
For the car of a particular make, the braking
distance was found to be 10 m, 20 m, 34 m and
50 m corresponding to velocities of 11, 15, 20
and 25 m/s which are nearly consistent with
the above formula.
Stopping distance is an important factor
considered in setting speed limits, for example,
in school zones.

Example 2.7 Reaction time : When a
situation demands our immediate
action, it takes some time before we
really respond. Reaction time is the
time a person takes to observe, think
and act. For example, if a person is
driving and suddenly a boy appears on
the road, then the time elapsed before
he slams the brakes of the car is the
reaction time. Reaction time depends
on complexity of the situation and on
an individual.
You can measure your reaction
time by a simple experiment. Take a
ruler and ask your friend to drop it
vertically through the gap between
your thumb and forefinger (Fig. 2.8).
After you catch it, find the distance d
travelled by the ruler. In a particular
case, d was found to be 21.0 cm.
Estimate reaction time.

SUMMARY
1.

An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with time. The position of the
object can be specified with reference to a conveniently chosen origin. For motion in
a straight line, position to the right of the origin is taken as positive and to the left as
negative.
The average speed of an object is greater or equal to the magnitude of the average
velocity over a given time interval.

2.

as the time interval ∆t becomes infinitesimally small :

v = lim v = lim

The acceleration of an object at a particular time is the slope of the velocity-time
graph at that instant of time. For uniform motion, acceleration is zero and the x-t
graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis and the v-t graph is a straight line
parallel to the time axis. For motion with uniform acceleration, x-t graph is a parabola
while the v-t graph is a straight line inclined to the time axis.
5.

The area under the velocity-time curve between times t1 and t2 is equal to the displacement
of the object during that interval of time.

For objects in uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion, the five quantities, displacement
x, time taken t, initial velocity v0, final velocity v and acceleration a are related by a set
of simple equations called kinematic equations of motion :

The origin and the positive direction of an axis are a matter of choice. You should first specify
this choice before you assign signs to quantities like displacement, velocity and acceleration.
If a particle is speeding up, acceleration is in the direction of velocity; if its speed is
decreasing, acceleration is in the direction opposite to that of the velocity. This
statement is independent of the choice of the origin and the axis.
The sign of acceleration does not tell us whether the particle’s speed is increasing or
decreasing. The sign of acceleration (as mentioned in point 3) depends on the choice
of the positive direction of the axis. For example, if the vertically upward direction is
chosen to be the positive direction of the axis, the acceleration due to gravity is
negative. If a particle is falling under gravity, this acceleration, though negative,
results in increase in speed. For a particle thrown upward, the same negative
acceleration (of gravity) results in decrease in speed.
The zero velocity of a particle at any instant does not necessarily imply zero acceleration
at that instant. A particle may be momentarily at rest and yet have non-zero acceleration.
For example, a particle thrown up has zero velocity at its uppermost point but the
acceleration at that instant continues to be the acceleration due to gravity.
In the kinematic equations of motion [Eq. (2.9)], the various quantities are algebraic,
i.e. they may be positive or negative. The equations are applicable in all situations
(for one dimensional motion with constant acceleration) provided the values of different
quantities are substituted in the equations with proper signs.
The definitions of instantaneous velocity and acceleration (Eqs. (2.1) and (2.3)) are
exact and are always correct while the kinematic equations (Eq. (2.9)) are true only for
motion in which the magnitude and the direction of acceleration are constant during
the course of motion.

Explain clearly, with examples, the distinction between :
(a) magnitude of displacement (sometimes called distance) over an interval of time,
and the total length of path covered by a particle over the same interval;
(b) magnitude of average velocity over an interval of time, and the average speed
over the same interval. [Average speed of a particle over an interval of time is
defined as the total path length divided by the time interval]. Show in both (a)

the first. When is the equality sign

0 to 50 min, (iii) 0 to 40 min ?
[Note: You will appreciate from this
exercise why it is better to define
average speed as total path length
divided by time, and not as
magnitude of average velocity. You
would not like to tell the tired man
on his return home that his
average speed was zero !]

In Exercises 2.9 and 2.10, we have
carefully distinguished between
average speed and magnitude of average
velocity. No such distinction is necessary when
we consider instantaneous speed and
magnitude of velocity. The instantaneous speed
is always equal to the magnitude of
instantaneous velocity. Why?

Summary
Points to ponder
Exercises

In the last chapter we developed the concepts of position,
displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to
describe the motion of an object along a straight line. We
found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be
taken care of by + and – signs, as in one dimension only two
directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an
object in two dimensions (a plane) or three dimensions
(space), we need to use vectors to describe the abovementioned physical quantities. Therefore, it is first necessary
to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector ? How to
add, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of
multiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this
to enable us to use vectors for defining velocity and
acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object
in a plane. As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall
discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail
the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of
motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.
We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.
The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a
plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions.
3.2 SCALARS AND VECTORS
In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or
vectors. Basically, the difference is that a direction is
associated with a vector but not with a scalar. A scalar
quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified
completely by a single number, along with the proper
unit. Examples are : the distance between two points,
mass of an object, the temperature of a body and the
time at which a certain event happened. The rules for
combining scalars are the rules of ordinary algebra.
Scalars can be added, subtracted, multiplied and divided



28

PHYSICS

just as the ordinary numbers*. For example,
if the length and breadth of a rectangle are
1.0 m and 0.5 m respectively, then its
perimeter is the sum of the lengths of the
four sides, 1.0 m + 0.5 m +1.0 m + 0.5 m =
3.0 m. The length of each side is a scalar
and the perimeter is also a scalar. Take
another example: the maximum and
minimum temperatures on a particular day
are 35.6 °C and 24.2 °C respectively. Then,
the difference between the two temperatures
is 11.4 °C. Similarly, if a uniform solid cube
of aluminium of side 10 cm has a mass of
2.7 kg, then its volume is 10–3 m3 (a scalar)
and its density is 2.7×103 kg m –3 (a scalar).
A vector quantity is a quantity that has both
a magnitude and a direction and obeys the
triangle law of addition or equivalently the
parallelogram law of addition. So, a vector is
specified by giving its magnitude by a number
and its direction. Some physical quantities that
are represented by vectors are displacement,
velocity, acceleration and force.
To represent a vector, we use a bold face type
in this book. Thus, a velocity vector can be
represented by a symbol v. Since bold face is
difficult to produce, when written by hand, a
vector is often represented
by an arrow placed
r
r
v
over a letter, say
. Thus, both v and v
represent the velocity vector. The magnitude of
a vector is often called its absolute value,
indicated by |v| = v. Thus, a vector is
represented by a bold face, e.g. by A, a, p, q, r, ...
x, y, with respective magnitudes denoted by light
face A, a, p, q, r, ... x, y.

represented by another position vector, OP′
denoted by r′. The length of the vector r
represents the magnitude of the vector and its
direction is the direction in which P lies as seen
from O. If the object moves from P to P′, the
vector PP′ (with tail at P and tip at P′) is called
the displacement vector corresponding to
motion from point P (at time t) to point P′ (at time t′).

3.2.1

Two vectors A and B are said to be equal if, and
only if, they have the same magnitude and the
same direction.**
Figure 3.2(a) shows two equal vectors A and
B. We can easily check their equality. Shift B
parallel to itself until its tail Q coincides with that
of A, i.e. Q coincides with O. Then, since their
tips S and P also coincide, the two vectors are
said to be equal. In general, equality is indicated

Position and Displacement Vectors

To describe the position of an object moving in
a plane, we need to choose a convenient point,
say O as origin. Let P and P′ be the positions of
the object at time t and t′, respectively [Fig. 3.1(a)].
We join O and P by a straight line. Then, OP is
the position vector of the object at time t. An
arrow is marked at the head of this line. It is
represented by a symbol r, i.e. OP = r. Point P′ is

Fig. 3.1 (a) Position and displacement vectors.
(b) Displacement vector PQ and different
courses of motion.

It is important to note that displacement
vector is the straight line joining the initial and
final positions and does not depend on the actual
path undertaken by the object between the two
positions. For example, in Fig. 3.1(b), given the
initial and final positions as P and Q, the
displacement vector is the same PQ for different
paths of journey, say PABCQ, PDQ, and PBEFQ.
Therefore, the magnitude of displacement is
either less or equal to the path length of an
object between two points. This fact was
emphasised in the previous chapter also while
discussing motion along a straight line.
3.2.2

Equality of Vectors

* Addition and subtraction of scalars make sense only for quantities with same units. However, you can multiply
and divide scalars of different units.

** In our study, vectors do not have fixed locations. So displacing a vector parallel to itself leaves the vector
unchanged. Such vectors are called free vectors. However, in some physical applications, location or line of
application of a vector is important. Such vectors are called localised vectors.



MOTION IN A PLANE

The factor λ by which a vector A is multiplied
could be a scalar having its own physical
dimension. Then, the dimension of λ A is the
product of the dimensions of λ and A. For
example, if we multiply a constant velocity vector
by duration (of time), we get a displacement
vector.
3.4 ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF
VECTORS — GRAPHICAL METHOD

vectors A′ and B′ are unequal though they
are of the same length.

as A = B. Note that in Fig. 3.2(b), vectors A′ and
B′ have the same magnitude but they are not
equal because they have different directions.
Even if we shift B′ parallel to itself so that its tail
Q′ coincides with the tail O′ of A′, the tip S′ of B′
does not coincide with the tip P′ of A′.
3.3 MULTIPLICATION OF VECTORS BY REAL
NUMBERS
Multiplying a vector A with a positive number λ
gives a vector whose magnitude is changed by
the factor λ but the direction is the same as that
of A :

As mentioned in section 4.2, vectors, by
definition, obey the triangle law or equivalently,
the parallelogram law of addition. We shall now
describe this law of addition using the graphical
method. Let us consider two vectors A and B that
lie in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.4(a). The lengths
of the line segments representing these vectors
are proportional to the magnitude of the vectors.
To find the sum A + B, we place vector B so that
its tail is at the head of the vector A, as in
Fig. 3.4(b). Then, we join the tail of A to the head
of B. This line OQ represents a vector R, that is,
the sum of the vectors A and B. Since, in this
procedure of vector addition, vectors are

λ A = λ A if λ > 0.
For example, if A is multiplied by 2, the resultant
vector 2A is in the same direction as A and has
a magnitude twice of |A| as shown in Fig. 3.3(a).
Multiplying a vector A by a negative number
−λ gives another vector whose direction is
opposite to the direction of A and whose
magnitude is λ times |A|.
Multiplying a given vector A by negative
numbers, say –1 and –1.5, gives vectors as
shown in Fig 3.3(b).

(c)

multiplying A by a positive number 2.

multiplying it by a negative number –1
and –1.5.

PHYSICS

arranged head to tail, this graphical method is
called the head-to-tail method. The two vectors
and their resultant form three sides of a triangle,
so this method is also known as triangle method
of vector addition. If we find the resultant of
B + A as in Fig. 3.4(c), the same vector R is
obtained. Thus, vector addition is commutative:
A+B=B+A

(3.1)

What is the physical meaning of a zero vector?
Consider the position and displacement vectors
in a plane as shown in Fig. 3.1(a). Now suppose
that an object which is at P at time t, moves to
P′ and then comes back to P. Then, what is its
displacement? Since the initial and final
positions coincide, the displacement is a “null
vector”.

The addition of vectors also obeys the associative
law as illustrated in Fig. 3.4(d). The result of
adding vectors A and B first and then adding
vector C is the same as the result of adding B
and C first and then adding vector A :

Subtraction of vectors can be defined in terms
of addition of vectors. We define the difference
of two vectors A and B as the sum of two vectors
A and –B :

(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)

It is shown in Fig 3.5. The vector –B is added to
vector A to get R2 = (A – B). The vector R1 = A + B
is also shown in the same figure for comparison.
We can also use the parallelogram method to
find the sum of two vectors. Suppose we have
two vectors A and B. To add these vectors, we
bring their tails to a common origin O as
shown in Fig. 3.6(a). Then we draw a line from
the head of A parallel to B and another line from
the head of B parallel to A to complete a
parallelogram OQSP. Now we join the point of
the intersection of these two lines to the origin
O. The resultant vector R is directed from the
common origin O along the diagonal (OS) of the
parallelogram [Fig. 3.6(b)]. In Fig.3.6(c), the
triangle law is used to obtain the resultant of A
and B and we see that the two methods yield the
same result. Thus, the two methods are
equivalent.

(3.2)

What is the result of adding two equal and
opposite vectors ? Consider two vectors A and
–A shown in Fig. 3.3(b). Their sum is A + (–A).
Since the magnitudes of the two vectors are the
same, but the directions are opposite, the
resultant vector has zero magnitude and is
represented by 0 called a null vector or a zero
vector :
A–A=0

|0|= 0

(3.3)

Since the magnitude of a null vector is zero, its
direction cannot be specified.
The null vector also results when we multiply
a vector A by the number zero. The main
properties of 0 are :
A+0=A
λ0=0
0A=0
(3.4)

A – B = A + (–B)

(3.5)

Fig. 3.5 (a) Two vectors A and B, – B is also shown. (b) Subtracting vector B from vector A – the result is R2. For
comparison, addition of vectors A and B, i.e. R1 is also shown.

3.5 RESOLUTION OF VECTORS

Example 3.1 Rain is falling vertically with
a speed of 35 m s–1. Winds starts blowing
after sometime with a speed of 12 m s–1 in
east to west direction. In which direction
should a boy waiting at a bus stop hold
his umbrella ?

Let a and b be any two non-zero vectors in a
plane with different directions and let A be
another vector in the same plane (Fig. 3.8). A
can be expressed as a sum of two vectors — one
obtained by multiplying a by a real number and
the other obtained by multiplying b by another
real number. To see this, let O and P be the tail
and head of the vector A. Then, through O, draw
a straight line parallel to a, and through P, a
straight line parallel to b. Let them intersect at
Q. Then, we have

⊳

A = OP = OQ + QP

(3.6)

But since OQ is parallel to a, and QP is parallel
to b, we can write :
OQ = λ a, and QP = µ b

Fig. 3.7

Answer The velocity of the rain and the wind
are represented by the vectors vr and vw in Fig.
3.7 and are in the direction specified by the
problem. Using the rule of vector addition, we
see that the resultant of vr and vw is R as shown
in the figure. The magnitude of R is

respectively. Using this method one can resolve
a given vector into two component vectors along
a set of two vectors – all the three lie in the same
plane. It is convenient to resolve a general vector
along the axes of a rectangular coordinate
system using vectors of unit magnitude. These
are called unit vectors that we discuss now. A
unit vector is a vector of unit magnitude and
points in a particular direction. It has no
dimension and unit. It is used to specify a
direction only. Unit vectors along the x-, y- and
z-axes of a rectangular coordinate system are
denoted by ɵi , ɵj and k̂ , respectively, as shown
in Fig. 3.9(a).
Since these are unit vectors, we have

 î  =  ĵ  =  k̂ =1

say n̂ by a scalar, the result is a vector

λ = λ n̂. In general, a vector A can be written as

Thus,

trigonometry, we can express Ax and Ay in terms
of the magnitude of A and the angle θ it makes
with the x-axis :
Ax = A cos θ
Ay = A sin θ

(3.13)

As is clear from Eq. (3.13), a component of a
vector can be positive, negative or zero
depending on the value of θ.
Now, we have two ways to specify a vector A
in a plane. It can be specified by :
(i) its magnitude A and the direction θ it makes
with the x-axis; or
(ii) its components Ax and Ay
If A and θ are given, Ax and Ay can be obtained
using Eq. (3.13). If Ax and Ay are given, A and θ
can be obtained as follows :

the head of A perpendicular to the coordinate
axes as in Fig. 3.9(b), and get vectors A1 and A2
such that A + A = A. Since A is parallel to ɵi

y

This is represented in Fig. 3.9(c). The quantities
Ax and Ay are called x-, and y- components of the
vector A. Note that Ax is itself not a vector, but
A ɵi is a vector, and so is A ɵj . Using simple

where n̂ is a unit vector along A.
We can now resolve a vector A in terms
of component vectors that lie along unit vectors

(3.9)

These unit vectors are perpendicular to each
other. In this text, they are printed in bold face
with a cap (^) to distinguish them from other
vectors. Since we are dealing with motion in two
dimensions in this chapter, we require use of
only two unit vectors. If we multiply a unit vector,

A = |A| n̂

A = A ɵi , A = A ɵj

MOTION IN A PLANE

33

So far we have considered a vector lying in
an x-y plane. The same procedure can be used
to resolve a general vector A into three
components along x-, y-, and z-axes in three
dimensions. If α , β, and γ are the angles *
between A and the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively
[Fig. 3.9(d)], we have

B = B x iɵ + By ɵj

Let R be their sum. We have
R=A+B

(

) (

= A x ɵi + Ay ɵj + B x iɵ + By ɵj

)

(3.19a)

Since vectors obey the commutative and
associative laws, we can arrange and regroup
the vectors in Eq. (3.19a) as convenient to us :

(

)

R = ( A x + B x ) ɵi + Ay + By ɵj
Since R = R x iɵ + Ry ɵj

(3.19b)
(3.20)

we have, R x = A x + B x , R y = Ay + B y
(3.21)
Thus, each component of the resultant
vector R is the sum of the corresponding
components of A and B.
In three dimensions, we have
A = A iɵ + A ɵj + A kɵ

B = B x iɵ + By ɵj + Bz kɵ

The magnitude of vector A is
(3.16c)
A = A x2 + Ay2 + Az2
A position vector r can be expressed as
ɵ
(3.17)
r = x ɵi + y ɵj + z k

This method can be extended to addition and
subtraction of any number of vectors. For
example, if vectors a, b and c are given as
a = a iɵ + a ɵj + a kɵ
x

A = A x iɵ + Ay ɵj

z

c = c x iɵ + c y ɵj + c z kɵ

(3.23a)

then, a vector T = a + b – c has components :
Tx = a x + b x − c x
Ty = a y + by − c y

(3.23b)

Tz = a z + b z − c z .

Although the graphical method of adding vectors
helps us in visualising the vectors and the
resultant vector, it is sometimes tedious and has
limited accuracy. It is much easier to add vectors
by combining their respective components.

Answer Let OP and OQ represent the two vectors
A and B making an angle θ (Fig. 3.10). Then,
using the parallelogram method of vector
addition, OS represents the resultant vector R :

towards north at 25 km/h and the water
current in that region is 10 km/h in the
direction of 60° east of south. Find the
resultant velocity of the boat.

Answer The vector vb representing the velocity
of the motorboat and the vector vc representing
the water current are shown in Fig. 3.11 in
directions specified by the problem. Using the
parallelogram method of addition, the resultant
R is obtained in the direction shown in the
figure.

R=A+B
SN is normal to OP and PM is normal to OS.
From the geometry of the figure,
OS2 = ON2 + SN2
but
ON = OP + PN = A + B cos θ
SN = B sin θ
OS2 = (A + B cos θ)2 + (B sin θ)2
R2 = A2 + B2 + 2AB cos θ

or,

R=

A 2 + B 2 + 2AB cos θ

In ∆ OSN, SN = OS sinα = R sinα, and
in ∆ PSN, SN = PS sin θ = B sin θ

3.7 MOTION IN A PLANE
In this section we shall see how to describe
motion in two dimensions using vectors.



MOTION IN A PLANE

3.7.1 Position Vector and Displacement
The position vector r of a particle P located in a
plane with reference to the origin of an x-y
reference frame (Fig. 3.12) is given by
r = x iɵ + y ɵj
where x and y are components of r along x-, and
y- axes or simply they are the coordinates of
the object.

Suppose a particle moves along the curve shown
by the thick line and is at P at time t and P′ at
time t′ [Fig. 3.12(b)]. Then, the displacement is :
∆r = r′ – r
(3.25)
and is directed from P to P′.
We can write Eq. (3.25) in a component form:
∆r

(

) (

= x' ɵi + y' ɵj − x iɵ + y ɵj

)

= ɵi∆x + ɵj∆y

where

∆x = x ′ – x, ∆y = y′ – y

(3.26)

Velocity
The average velocity ( v ) of an object is the ratio
of the displacement and the corresponding time
interval :
v=

Or,

Since v =

, the direction of the average velocity

is the same as that of ∆r (Fig. 3.12). The velocity
(instantaneous velocity) is given by the limiting
value of the average velocity as the time interval
approaches zero :

∆ r dr

∆t → 0 ∆ t

The meaning of the limiting process can be easily
understood with the help of Fig 3.13(a) to (d). In
these figures, the thick line represents the path
of an object, which is at P at time t. P1, P2 and
P3 represent the positions of the object after
times ∆t1,∆t2, and ∆t3. ∆r1, ∆r2, and ∆r3 are the
displacements of the object in times ∆t1, ∆t2, and
v = lim

∆t3, respectively. The direction of the average
velocity v is shown in figures (a), (b) and (c) for
three decreasing values of ∆t, i.e. ∆t1,∆t2, and ∆t3,
( ∆ t 1 > ∆ t 2 > ∆ t 3 ). As ∆ t → 0, ∆ r → 0
and is along the tangent to the path [Fig. 3.13(d)].
Therefore, the direction of velocity at any point
on the path of an object is tangential to the
path at that point and is in the direction of
motion.
We can express v in a component form :
v=

time interval ∆t moving in x-y plane is the change
in velocity divided by the time interval :
a=

Or,

∆v

these equations to find vx and vy.

As in the case of velocity, we can understand
graphically the limiting process used in defining
acceleration on a graph showing the path of the
object’s motion. This is shown in Figs. 3.15(a) to
(d). P represents the position of the object at
time t and P1, P2, P3 positions after time ∆t1, ∆t2,
∆t3, respectively (∆t 1> ∆t2>∆t3). The velocity vectors
at points P, P1, P2, P3 are also shown in Figs. 3.15
(a), (b) and (c). In each case of ∆t, ∆v is obtained
using the triangle law of vector addition. By
definition, the direction of average acceleration
is the same as that of ∆v. We see that as ∆t
decreases, the direction of ∆v changes and
consequently, the direction of the acceleration
changes. Finally, in the limit ∆t g0 [Fig. 3.15(d)],
the average acceleration becomes the
instantaneous acceleration and has the direction
as shown.

* In terms of x and y, ax and ay can be expressed as

limit ∆t g0, the average acceleration becomes the acceleration.

Note that in one dimension, the velocity and
the acceleration of an object are always along
the same straight line (either in the same
direction or in the opposite direction).
However, for motion in two or three
dimensions, velocity and acceleration vectors
may have any angle between 0° and 180°
between them.

3.8 MOTION IN A PLANE WITH CONSTANT
ACCELERATION
Suppose that an object is moving in x-y plane
and its acceleration a is constant. Over an
interval of time, the average acceleration will
equal this constant value. Now, let the velocity
of the object be v0 at time t = 0 and v at time t.
Then, by definition
a=

v − v0
v − v0
=
t−0
t

Or, v = v 0 + at
In terms of components :

(3.33a)

v x = v ox + a x t

v y = v oy + a y t

(3.33b)

Let us now find how the position r changes with
time. We follow the method used in the onedimensional case. Let ro and r be the position
vectors of the particle at time 0 and t and let the
velocities at these instants be vo and v. Then,
over this time interval t, the average velocity is
(vo + v)/2. The displacement is the average
velocity multiplied by the time interval :

Or,

It can be easily verified that the derivative of

gives Eq.(3.33a) and it also
dt
satisfies the condition that at t=0, r = r o .

form as

Eq. (3.34a), i.e.

x = x 0 + v ox t + a x t 2

(3.34b)

One immediate interpretation of Eq.(3.34b) is that
the motions in x- and y-directions can be treated
independently of each other. That is, motion in
a plane (two-dimensions) can be treated as two
separate simultaneous one-dimensional
motions with constant acceleration along two
perpendicular directions. This is an important
result and is useful in analysing motion of objects
in two dimensions. A similar result holds for three
dimensions. The choice of perpendicular
directions is convenient in many physical
situations, as we shall see in section 3.9 for
projectile motion.

Example 3.5 A particle starts from origin
at t = 0 with a velocity 5.0 î m/s and moves
in x-y plane under action of a force which
produces a constant acceleration of
(3.0iɵ +2.0jɵ ) m/s 2 . (a) What is the

⊳

y-coordinate of the particle at the instant
its x-coordinate is 84 m ? (b) What is the
speed of the particle at this time ?

Therefore,

x (t ) = 5.0 t + 1.5 t 2

5.0 t + 1.5 t 2 = 84 ⇒ t = 6 s
At t = 6 s, y = 1.0 (6)2 = 36.0 m
dr
= (5.0 + 3.0 t ) ˆi + 2.0 t ˆj
dt
At t = 6 s, v = 23.0iɵ + 12.0 ɵj

Now, the velocity v =

speed = v = 232 + 122 ≅ 26 m s−1 .

Answer From Eq. (3.34a) for r0 = 0, the position
of the particle is given by

As an application of the ideas developed in the
previous sections, we consider the motion of a
projectile. An object that is in flight after being
thrown or projected is called a projectile. Such
a projectile might be a football, a cricket ball, a
baseball or any other object. The motion of a
projectile may be thought of as the result of two
separate, simultaneously occurring components
of motions. One component is along a horizontal
direction without any acceleration and the other
along the vertical direction with constant
acceleration due to the force of gravity. It was
Galileo who first stated this independency of the
horizontal and the vertical components of
projectile motion in his Dialogue on the great
world systems (1632).
In our discussion, we shall assume that the
air resistance has negligible effect on the motion
of the projectile. Suppose that the projectile is
launched with velocity vo that makes an angle
θo with the x-axis as shown in Fig. 3.16.
After the object has been projected, the
acceleration acting on it is that due to gravity
which is directed vertically downward:
a = −g ɵj

ax = 0, ay = – g

MOTION IN A PLANE

39

Now, since g, θo and vo are constants, Eq. (3.39)
is of the form y = a x + b x2, in which a and b are
constants. This is the equation of a parabola,
i.e. the path of the projectile is a parabola
(Fig. 3.17).

Fig 3.16 Motion of an object projected with velocity
vo at angle θ0.

If we take the initial position to be the origin of
the reference frame as shown in Fig. 3.16, we
have :
xo = 0, yo = 0
Then, Eq.(3.34b) becomes :
and

x = vox t = (vo cos θo ) t
y = (vo sin θo ) t – ( ½ )g t2

(3.37)

The components of velocity at time t can be
obtained using Eq.(3.33b) :
vx = vox = vo cos θo
vy = vo sin θo – g t

(3.38)

Equation (3.37) gives the x-, and y-coordinates
of the position of a projectile at time t in terms of
two parameters — initial speed vo and projection
angle θo. Notice that the choice of mutually
perpendicular x-, and y-directions for the
analysis of the projectile motion has resulted in
a simplification. One of the components of
velocity, i.e. x-component remains constant
throughout the motion and only the
y- component changes, like an object in free fall
in vertical direction. This is shown graphically
at few instants in Fig. 3.17. Note that at the point
of maximum height, vy= 0 and therefore,

θ = tan-1

Time of maximum height
How much time does the projectile take to reach the
maximum height ? Let this time be denoted by tm.
Since at this point, vy= 0, we have from Eq. (3.38):
vy = vo sinθo – g tm = 0
Or,
tm = vo sinθo /g
(3.40a)
The total time Tf during which the projectile is
in flight can be obtained by putting y = 0 in
Eq. (3.37). We get :
Tf = 2 (vo sin θo )/g

Tf is known as the time of flight of the projectile.
We note that Tf = 2 tm , which is expected
because of the symmetry of the parabolic path.
Maximum height of a projectile
The maximum height h m reached by the
projectile can be calculated by substituting
t = tm in Eq. (3.37) :

(

What is the shape of the path followed by the
projectile? This can be seen by eliminating the
time between the expressions for x and y as
given in Eq. (3.37). We obtain:

Equation (3.42a) shows that for a given
projection velocity vo , R is maximum when sin
2θ0 is maximum, i.e., when θ0 = 450.
The maximum horizontal range is, therefore,

y (t) = yo + voy t +(1/2) ay t2
Here, xo = yo = 0, voy = 0, ay = –g = –9.8 m s-2,
vox = 15 m s-1.
The stone hits the ground when y(t) = – 490 m.
– 490 m = –(1/2)(9.8) t2.
This gives t =10 s.
The velocity components are vx = vox and
vy = voy – g t
so that when the stone hits the ground :
vox = 15 m s–1

Answer (a) The maximum height is given by

Now, for angles, (45° + α ) and ( 45° – α), 2θo is
(90° + 2α ) and ( 90° – 2α ) , respectively. The
values of sin (90° + 2α ) and sin (90° – 2α ) are
the same, equal to that of cos 2α. Therefore,
ranges are equal for elevations which exceed or
fall short of 45° by equal amounts α.

Answer We choose the origin of the x-,and yaxis at the edge of the cliff and t = 0 s at the
instant the stone is thrown. Choose the positive
direction of x-axis to be along the initial velocity
and the positive direction of y-axis to be the
vertically upward direction. The x-, and ycomponents of the motion can be treated

3.10 UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION
When an object follows a circular path at a
constant speed, the motion of the object is called
uniform circular motion. The word “uniform”
refers to the speed, which is uniform (constant)
throughout the motion. Suppose an object is
moving with uniform speed v in a circle of radius
R as shown in Fig. 3.18. Since the velocity of the
object is changing continuously in direction, the
object undergoes acceleration. Let us find the
magnitude and the direction of this acceleration.



MOTION IN A PLANE

41

Fig. 3.18 Velocity and acceleration of an object in uniform circular motion. The time interval ∆t decreases from
(a) to (c) where it is zero. The acceleration is directed, at each point of the path, towards the centre of
the circle.

Let r and r′ be the position vectors and v and
v′ the velocities of the object when it is at point P
and P ′ as shown in Fig. 3.18(a). By definition,
velocity at a point is along the tangent at that
point in the direction of motion. The velocity
vectors v and v′ are as shown in Fig. 3.18(a1).
∆v is obtained in Fig. 3.18 (a2) using the triangle
law of vector addition. Since the path is circular,
v is perpendicular to r and so is v′ to r′.
Therefore, ∆v is perpendicular to ∆r. Since


average acceleration is along ∆v  a =


lim

∆v

∆v 
 , the
∆t 

average acceleration a is perpendicular to ∆r. If
we place ∆v on the line that bisects the angle
between r and r′, we see that it is directed towards
the centre of the circle. Figure 3.18(b) shows the
same quantities for smaller time interval. ∆v and
hence a is again directed towards the centre.
In Fig. 3.18(c), ∆t Ž 0 and the average
acceleration becomes the instantaneous
acceleration. It is directed towards the centre*.
Thus, we find that the acceleration of an object
in uniform circular motion is always directed
towards the centre of the circle. Let us now find
the magnitude of the acceleration.
The magnitude of a is, by definition, given by
a =

r′ be ∆θ. Since the velocity vectors v and v′ are
always perpendicular to the position vectors, the
angle between them is also ∆θ . Therefore, the
triangle CPP′ formed by the position vectors and
the triangle GHI formed by the velocity vectors
v, v′ and ∆v are similar (Fig. 3.18a). Therefore,
the ratio of the base-length to side-length for
one of the triangles is equal to that of the other
triangle. That is :

Therefore, the centripetal acceleration ac is :

* In the limit ∆tŽ0, ∆r becomes perpendicular to r. In this limit ∆v→ 0 and is consequently also perpendicular
to V. Therefore, the acceleration is directed towards the centre, at each point of the circular path.



42

PHYSICS

(3.43)

Thus, the acceleration of an object moving with
speed v in a circle of radius R has a magnitude
2
v /R and is always directed towards the centre.
This is why this acceleration is called centripetal
acceleration (a term proposed by Newton). A
thorough analysis of centripetal acceleration was
first published in 1673 by the Dutch scientist
Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695) but it was
probably known to Newton also some years earlier.
“Centripetal” comes from a Greek term which means
‘centre-seeking’. Since v and R are constant, the
magnitude of the centripetal acceleration is also
constant. However, the direction changes —
pointing always towards the centre. Therefore, a
centripetal acceleration is not a constant vector.
We have another way of describing the
velocity and the acceleration of an object in
uniform circular motion. As the object moves
from P to P′ in time ∆t (= t′ – t), the line CP
(Fig. 3.18) turns through an angle ∆θ as shown
in the figure. ∆θ is called angular distance. We
define the angular speed ω (Greek letter omega)
as the time rate of change of angular
displacement :
ω=

∆θ

(3.44)

∆t

Now, if the distance travelled by the object
during the time ∆t is ∆s, i.e. PP′ is ∆s, then :

The time taken by an object to make one revolution
is known as its time period T and the number of
revolution made in one second is called its
frequency ν (=1/T ). However, during this time
the distance moved by the object is s = 2πR.
Therefore, v = 2πR/T =2πRν

circular groove of radius 12 cm moves along
the groove steadily and completes 7
revolutions in 100 s. (a) What is the
angular speed, and the linear speed of the
motion? (b) Is the acceleration vector a
constant vector ? What is its magnitude ?

Answer This is an example of uniform circular
motion. Here R = 12 cm. The angular speed ω is
given by
ω = 2π/T = 2π × 7/100 = 0.44 rad/s
The linear speed v is :
v =ω R = 0.44 s-1 × 12 cm = 5.3 cm s-1
The direction of velocity v is along the tangent
to the circle at every point. The acceleration is
directed towards the centre of the circle. Since
this direction changes continuously,
acceleration here is not a constant vector.
However, the magnitude of acceleration is
constant:
a = ω2 R = (0.44 s–1)2 (12 cm)



= 2.3 cm s-2

Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitudes only. Examples are distance, speed,
mass and temperature.
Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and direction both. Examples are
displacement, velocity and acceleration. They obey special rules of vector algebra.
A vector A multiplied by a real number λ is also a vector, whose magnitude is λ times
the magnitude of the vector A and whose direction is the same or opposite depending
upon whether λ is positive or negative.
Two vectors A and B may be added graphically using head-to-tail method or parallelogram
method.
Vector addition is commutative :
A+B=B+A
It also obeys the associative law :
(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)
A null or zero vector is a vector with zero magnitude. Since the magnitude is zero, we
don’t have to specify its direction. It has the properties :
A+0=A
λ0 = 0
0A=0
The subtraction of vector B from A is defined as the sum of A and –B :
A – B = A+ (–B)
A vector A can be resolved into component along two given vectors a and b lying in the
same plane :
A=λa+µb
where λ and µ are real numbers.
A unit vector associated with a vector A has magnitude 1 and is along the vector A:

Motion in a plane can be treated as superposition of two separate simultaneous onedimensional motions along two perpendicular directions
An object that is in flight after being projected is called a projectile. If an object is
projected with initial velocity vo making an angle θo with x-axis and if we assume its
initial position to coincide with the origin of the coordinate system, then the position
and velocity of the projectile at time t are given by :
x = (vo cos θo) t
y = (vo sin θo) t − (1/2) g t2
vx = vox = vo cos θo
vy = vo sin θo − g t

When an object follows a circular path at constant speed, the motion of the object is
called uniform circular motion. The magnitude of its acceleration is ac = v2 /R. The
direction of ac is always towards the centre of the circle.
The angular speed ω, is the rate of change of angular distance. It is related to velocity
v by v = ω R. The acceleration is ac = ω 2R.
If T is the time period of revolution of the object in circular motion and ν is its
frequency, we have ω = 2π ν, v = 2πνR, ac = 4π2ν2R

POINTS TO PONDER
1. The path length traversed by an object between two points is, in general, not the same as
the magnitude of displacement. The displacement depends only on the end points; the
path length (as the name implies) depends on the actual path. The two quantities are
equal only if the object does not change its direction during the course of motion. In all
other cases, the path length is greater than the magnitude of displacement.
2. In view of point 1 above, the average speed of an object is greater than or equal to the
magnitude of the average velocity over a given time interval. The two are equal only if the
path length is equal to the magnitude of displacement.
3. The vector equations (3.33a) and (3.34a) do not involve any choice of axes. Of course,
you can always resolve them along any two independent axes.
4. The kinematic equations for uniform acceleration do not apply to the case of uniform
circular motion since in this case the magnitude of acceleration is constant but its
direction is changing.
5. An object subjected to two velocities v1 and v2 has a resultant velocity v = v1 + v2. Take
care to distinguish it from velocity of object 1 relative to velocity of object 2 : v12= v1 − v2.
Here v1 and v2 are velocities with reference to some common reference frame.
6. The resultant acceleration of an object in circular motion is towards the centre only if
the speed is constant.
7. The shape of the trajectory of the motion of an object is not determined by the acceleration
alone but also depends on the initial conditions of motion ( initial position and initial
velocity). For example, the trajectory of an object moving under the same acceleration
due to gravity can be a straight line or a parabola depending on the initial conditions.

In the preceding Chapter, our concern was to describe the
motion of a particle in space quantitatively. We saw that
uniform motion needs the concept of velocity alone whereas
non-uniform motion requires the concept of acceleration in
addition. So far, we have not asked the question as to what
governs the motion of bodies. In this chapter, we turn to this
basic question.
Let us first guess the answer based on our common
experience. To move a football at rest, someone must kick it.
To throw a stone upwards, one has to give it an upward
push. A breeze causes the branches of a tree to swing; a
strong wind can even move heavy objects. A boat moves in a
flowing river without anyone rowing it. Clearly, some external
agency is needed to provide force to move a body from rest.
Likewise, an external force is needed also to retard or stop
motion. You can stop a ball rolling down an inclined plane by
applying a force against the direction of its motion.
In these examples, the external agency of force (hands,
wind, stream, etc) is in contact with the object. This is not
always necessary. A stone released from the top of a building
accelerates downward due to the gravitational pull of the
earth. A bar magnet can attract an iron nail from a distance.
This shows that external agencies (e.g. gravitational and
magnetic forces ) can exert force on a body even from a
distance.
In short, a force is required to put a stationary body in
motion or stop a moving body, and some external agency is
needed to provide this force. The external agency may or may
not be in contact with the body.
So far so good. But what if a body is moving uniformly (e.g.
a skater moving straight with constant speed on a horizontal
ice slab) ? Is an external force required to keep a body in
uniform motion?



50

PHYSICS

4.2 ARISTOTLE’S FALLACY
The question posed above appears to be simple.
However, it took ages to answer it. Indeed, the
correct answer to this question given by Galileo
in the seventeenth century was the foundation
of Newtonian mechanics, which signalled the
birth of modern science.
The Greek thinker, Aristotle (384 B.C– 322
B.C.), held the view that if a body is moving,
something external is required to keep it moving.
According to this view, for example, an arrow
shot from a bow keeps flying since the air behind
the arrow keeps pushing it. The view was part of
an elaborate framework of ideas developed by
Aristotle on the motion of bodies in the universe.
Most of the Aristotelian ideas on motion are now
known to be wrong and need not concern us.
For our purpose here, the Aristotelian law of
motion may be phrased thus: An external force
is required to keep a body in motion.
Aristotelian law of motion is flawed, as we shall
see. However, it is a natural view that anyone
would hold from common experience. Even a
small child playing with a simple (non-electric)
toy-car on a floor knows intuitively that it needs
to constantly drag the string attached to the toycar with some force to keep it going. If it releases
the string, it comes to rest. This experience is
common to most terrestrial motion. External
forces seem to be needed to keep bodies in
motion. Left to themselves, all bodies eventually
come to rest.
What is the flaw in Aristotle’s argument? The
answer is: a moving toy car comes to rest because
the external force of friction on the car by the floor
opposes its motion. To counter this force, the child
has to apply an external force on the car in the
direction of motion. When the car is in uniform
motion, there is no net external force acting on it:
the force by the child cancels the force ( friction)
by the floor. The corollary is: if there were no friction,
the child would not be required to apply any force
to keep the toy car in uniform motion.
The opposing forces such as friction (solids)
and viscous forces (for fluids) are always present
in the natural world. This explains why forces
by external agencies are necessary to overcome
the frictional forces to keep bodies in uniform
motion. Now we understand where Aristotle
went wrong. He coded this practical experience
in the form of a basic argument. To get at the

true law of nature for forces and motion, one has
to imagine a world in which uniform motion is
possible with no frictional forces opposing. This
is what Galileo did.
4.3 THE LAW OF INERTIA
Galileo studied motion of objects on an inclined
plane. Objects (i) moving down an inclined plane
accelerate, while those (ii) moving up retard.
(iii) Motion on a horizontal plane is an intermediate situation. Galileo concluded that an object
moving on a frictionless horizontal plane must
neither have acceleration nor retardation, i.e. it
should move with constant velocity (Fig. 4.1(a)).

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

Fig. 4.1(a)

Another experiment by Galileo leading to the
same conclusion involves a double inclined plane.
A ball released from rest on one of the planes rolls
down and climbs up the other. If the planes are
smooth, the final height of the ball is nearly the
same as the initial height (a little less but never
greater). In the ideal situation, when friction is
absent, the final height of the ball is the same
as its initial height.
If the slope of the second plane is decreased
and the experiment repeated, the ball will still
reach the same height, but in doing so, it will
travel a longer distance. In the limiting case, when
the slope of the second plane is zero (i.e. is a
horizontal) the ball travels an infinite distance.
In other words, its motion never ceases. This is,
of course, an idealised situation (Fig. 4.1(b)).

Fig. 4.1(b) The law of inertia was inferred by Galileo
from observations of motion of a ball on a
double inclined plane.



LAWS OF MOTION

51

In practice, the ball does come to a stop after
moving a finite distance on the horizontal plane,
because of the opposing force of friction which
can never be totally eliminated. However, if there
were no friction, the ball would continue to move
with a constant velocity on the horizontal plane.
Galileo thus, arrived at a new insight on
motion that had eluded Aristotle and those who
followed him. The state of rest and the state of
uniform linear motion (motion with constant
velocity) are equivalent. In both cases, there is

accomplished almost single-handedly by Isaac
Newton, one of the greatest scientists of all times.
Newton built on Galileo’s ideas and laid the
foundation of mechanics in terms of three laws
of motion that go by his name. Galileo’s law of
inertia was his starting point which he formulated as the first law of motion:
Every body continues to be in its state
of rest or of uniform motion in a straight
line unless compelled by some external
force to act otherwise.

Ideas on Motion in Ancient Indian Science
Ancient Indian thinkers had arrived at an elaborate system of ideas on motion. Force, the cause of
motion, was thought to be of different kinds : force due to continuous pressure (nodan), as the force
of wind on a sailing vessel; impact (abhighat), as when a potter’s rod strikes the wheel; persistent
tendency (sanskara) to move in a straight line(vega) or restoration of shape in an elastic body;
transmitted force by a string, rod, etc. The notion of (vega) in the Vaisesika theory of motion perhaps
comes closest to the concept of inertia. Vega, the tendency to move in a straight line, was thought to
be opposed by contact with objects including atmosphere, a parallel to the ideas of friction and air
resistance. It was correctly summarised that the different kinds of motion (translational, rotational
and vibrational) of an extended body arise from only the translational motion of its constituent
particles. A falling leaf in the wind may have downward motion as a whole (patan) and also rotational
and vibrational motion (bhraman, spandan), but each particle of the leaf at an instant only has a
definite (small) displacement. There was considerable focus in Indian thought on measurement of
motion and units of length and time. It was known that the position of a particle in space can be
indicated by distance measured along three axes. Bhaskara (1150 A.D.) had introduced the concept
of ‘instantaneous motion’ (tatkaliki gati), which anticipated the modern notion of instantaneous
velocity using Differential Calculus. The difference between a wave and a current (of water) was clearly
understood; a current is a motion of particles of water under gravity and fluidity while a wave results
from the transmission of vibrations of water particles.

no net force acting on the body. It is incorrect to
assume that a net force is needed to keep a body
in uniform motion. To maintain a body in
uniform motion, we need to apply an external
force to ecounter the frictional force, so that
the two forces sum up to zero net external
force.
To summarise, if the net external force is zero,
a body at rest continues to remain at rest and a
body in motion continues to move with a uniform
velocity. This property of the body is called
inertia. Inertia means ‘resistance to change’.
A body does not change its state of rest or
uniform motion, unless an external force
compels it to change that state.
4.4 NEWTON’S FIRST LAW OF MOTION
Galileo’s simple, but revolutionary ideas
dethroned Aristotelian mechanics. A new
mechanics had to be developed. This task was

The state of rest or uniform linear motion both
imply zero acceleration. The first law of motion can,
therefore, be simply expressed as:
If the net external force on a body is zero, its
acceleration is zero. Acceleration can be non
zero only if there is a net external force on
the body.
Two kinds of situations are encountered in the
application of this law in practice. In some
examples, we know that the net external force
on the object is zero. In that case we can
conclude that the acceleration of the object is
zero. For example, a spaceship out in
interstellar space, far from all other objects and
with all its rockets turned off, has no net
external force acting on it. Its acceleration,
according to the first law, must be zero. If it is
in motion, it must continue to move with a
uniform velocity.



52

PHYSICS

More often, however, we do not know all the
forces to begin with. In that case, if we know
that an object is unaccelerated (i.e. it is either
at rest or in uniform linear motion), we can infer
from the first law that the net external force on
the object must be zero. Gravity is everywhere.
For terrestrial phenomena, in particular, every
object experiences gravitational force due to the
earth. Also objects in motion generally experience
friction, viscous drag, etc. If then, on earth, an
object is at rest or in uniform linear motion, it is
not because there are no forces acting on it, but
because the various external forces cancel out
i.e. add up to zero net external force.
Consider a book at rest on a horizontal surface
Fig. (4.2(a)). It is subject to two external forces :
the force due to gravity (i.e. its weight W) acting
downward and the upward force on the book by
the table, the normal force R . R is a self-adjusting
force. This is an example of the kind of situation
mentioned above. The forces are not quite known
fully but the state of motion is known. We observe
the book to be at rest. Therefore, we conclude
from the first law that the magnitude of R equals
that of W. A statement often encountered is :
“Since W = R, forces cancel and, therefore, the book
is at rest”. This is incorrect reasoning. The correct
statement is : “Since the book is observed to be at
rest, the net external force on it must be zero,
according to the first law. This implies that the
normal force R must be equal and opposite to the
weight W ”.

The acceleration of the car cannot be accounted
for by any internal force. This might sound
surprising, but it is true. The only conceivable
external force along the road is the force of
friction. It is the frictional force that accelerates
the car as a whole. (You will learn about friction
in section 4.9). When the car moves with
constant velocity, there is no net external force.
The property of inertia contained in the First
law is evident in many situations. Suppose we
are standing in a stationary bus and the driver
starts the bus suddenly. We get thrown
backward with a jerk. Why ? Our feet are in touch
with the floor. If there were no friction, we would
remain where we were, while the floor of the bus
would simply slip forward under our feet and the
back of the bus would hit us. However,
fortunately, there is some friction between the
feet and the floor. If the start is not too sudden,
i.e. if the acceleration is moderate, the frictional
force would be enough to accelerate our feet
along with the bus. But our body is not strictly
a rigid body. It is deformable, i.e. it allows some
relative displacement between different parts.
What this means is that while our feet go with
the bus, the rest of the body remains where it is
due to inertia. Relative to the bus, therefore, we
are thrown backward. As soon as that happens,
however, the muscular forces on the rest of the
body (by the feet) come into play to move the body
along with the bus. A similar thing happens
when the bus suddenly stops. Our feet stop due
to the friction which does not allow relative
motion between the feet and the floor of the bus.
But the rest of the body continues to move
forward due to inertia. We are thrown forward.
The restoring muscular forces again come into
play and bring the body to rest.

rest, picking up speed and then moving on a
smooth straight road with uniform speed (Fig.
(4.2(b)). When the car is stationary, there is no
net force acting on it. During pick-up, it
accelerates. This must happen due to a net
external force. Note, it has to be an external force.

Example 4.1 An astronaut accidentally
gets separated out of his small spaceship
accelerating in inter stellar space at a
constant rate of 100 m s–2. What is the
acceleration of the astronaut the instant after
he is outside the spaceship ? (Assume that
there are no nearby stars to exert
gravitational force on him.)

Answer Since there are no nearby stars to exert
gravitational force on him and the small
spaceship exerts negligible gravitational
attraction on him, the net force acting on the

act. One reason is that the cricketer allows a
longer time for his hands to stop the ball. As
you may have noticed, he draws in the hands
backward in the act of catching the ball
(Fig. 4.3). The novice, on the other hand,
keeps his hands fixed and tries to catch the
ball almost instantly. He needs to provide a
much greater force to stop the ball instantly,
and this hurts. The conclusion is clear: force
not only depends on the change in momentum,
but also on how fast the change is brought
about. The same change in momentum
brought about in a shorter time needs a
greater applied force. In short, the greater the
rate of change of momentum, the greater is
the force.

astronaut, once he is out of the spaceship, is
zero. By the first law of motion the acceleration
of the astronaut is zero.
⊳
4.5 NEWTON’S SECOND LAW OF MOTION
The first law refers to the simple case when the
net external force on a body is zero. The second
law of motion refers to the general situation when
there is a net external force acting on the body.
It relates the net external force to the
acceleration of the body.
Momentum
Momentum of a body is defined to be the product
of its mass m and velocity v, and is denoted
by p:
p=mv
(4.1)
Momentum is clearly a vector quantity. The
following common experiences indicate the
importance of this quantity for considering the
effect of force on motion.
• Suppose a light-weight vehicle (say a small
car) and a heavy weight vehicle (say a loaded
truck) are parked on a horizontal road. We all
know that a much greater force is needed to
push the truck than the car to bring them to
the same speed in same time. Similarly, a
greater opposing force is needed to stop a
heavy body than a light body in the same time,
if they are moving with the same speed.
• If two stones, one light and the other heavy,
are dropped from the top of a building, a
person on the ground will find it easier to catch
the light stone than the heavy stone. The
mass of a body is thus an important
parameter that determines the effect of force
on its motion.
• Speed is another important parameter to
consider. A bullet fired by a gun can easily
pierce human tissue before it stops, resulting
in casualty. The same bullet fired with
moderate speed will not cause much damage.
Thus for a given mass, the greater the speed,
the greater is the opposing force needed to stop
the body in a certain time. Taken together,
the product of mass and velocity, that is
momentum, is evidently a relevant variable
of motion. The greater the change in the
momentum in a given time, the greater is the
force that needs to be applied.
• A seasoned cricketer catches a cricket ball
coming in with great speed far more easily
than a novice, who can hurt his hands in the

Fig. 4.3 Force not only depends on the change in
momentum but also on how fast the change
is brought about. A seasoned cricketer draws
in his hands during a catch, allowing greater
time for the ball to stop and hence requires a
smaller force.

• Observations confirm that the product of

•

mass and velocity (i.e. momentum) is basic to
the effect of force on motion. Suppose a fixed
force is applied for a certain interval of time
on two bodies of different masses, initially at
rest, the lighter body picks up a greater speed
than the heavier body. However, at the end of
the time interval, observations show that each
body acquires the same momentum. Thus
the same force for the same time causes
the same change in momentum for
different bodies. This is a crucial clue to the
second law of motion.
In the preceding observations, the vector



54

PHYSICS

character of momentum has not been evident.
In the examples so far, momentum and change
in momentum both have the same direction.
But this is not always the case. Suppose a
stone is rotated with uniform speed in a
horizontal plane by means of a string, the
magnitude of momentum is fixed, but its
direction changes (Fig. 4.4). A force is needed
to cause this change in momentum vector.
This force is provided by our hand through
the string. Experience suggests that our hand
needs to exert a greater force if the stone is
rotated at greater speed or in a circle of
smaller radius, or both. This corresponds to
greater acceleration or equivalently a greater
rate of change in momentum vector. This
suggests that the greater the rate of change
in momentum vector the greater is the force
applied.

i.e the Second Law can also be written as

product of mass m and acceleration a.
The unit of force has not been defined so far.
In fact, we use Eq. (4.4) to define the unit of force.
We, therefore, have the liberty to choose any
constant value for k. For simplicity, we choose
k = 1. The second law then is
F=

Fig. 4.4

Force is necessary for changing the direction
of momentum, even if its magnitude is
constant. We can feel this while rotating a
stone in a horizontal circle with uniform speed
by means of a string.

These qualitative observations lead to the
second law of motion expressed by Newton as
follows :

dp
= ma
dt

(4.5)

In SI unit force is one that causes an acceleration
of 1 m s-2 to a mass of 1 kg. This unit is known as
newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.
Let us note at this stage some important points
about the second law :
1. In the second law, F = 0 implies a = 0. The second
law is obviously consistent with the first law.
2. The second law of motion is a vector law. It is
equivalent to three equations, one for each
component of the vectors :

The rate of change of momentum of a body is
directly proportional to the applied force and
takes place in the direction in which the force
acts.
Thus, if under the action of a force F for time
interval ∆t, the velocity of a body of mass m
changes from v to v + ∆v i.e. its initial momentum
p = m v changes by ∆p = m ∆v . According to the
Second Law,



Fx =

(4.6)

This means that if a force is not parallel to
the velocity of the body, but makes some angle
with it, it changes only the component of
velocity along the direction of force. The

LAWS OF MOTION

component of velocity normal to the force
remains unchanged. For example, in the
motion of a projectile under the vertical
gravitational force, the horizontal component
of velocity remains unchanged (Fig. 4.5).

Answer The retardation ‘a’ of the bullet
(assumed constant) is given by

3. The second law of motion given by Eq. (4.5) is
applicable to a single point particle. The force
F in the law stands for the net external force
on the particle and a stands for acceleration
of the particle. It turns out, however, that the
law in the same form applies to a rigid body or,
even more generally, to a system of particles.
In that case, F refers to the total external force
on the system and a refers to the acceleration
of the system as a whole. More precisely, a is
the acceleration of the centre of mass of the
system about which we shall study in detail in
Chapter 6. Any internal forces in the system
are not to be included in F.

The retarding force, by the second law of
motion, is

The actual resistive force, and therefore,

answer therefore, only indicates the average
resistive force.

Fig. 4.5 Acceleration at an instant is determined by
the force at that instant. The moment after a
stone is dropped out of an accelerated train,
it has no horizontal acceleration or force, if
air resistance is neglected. The stone carries
no memory of its acceleration with the train
a moment ago.

4. The second law of motion is a local relation
which means that force F at a point in space
(location of the particle) at a certain instant
of time is related to a at that point at that
instant. Acceleration here and now is
determined by the force here and now, not by
any history of the motion of the particle
(See Fig. 4.5).

Example 4.2 A bullet of mass 0.04 kg
moving with a speed of 90 m s–1 enters a
heavy wooden block and is stopped after a
distance of 60 cm. What is the average
resistive force exerted by the block on the
bullet?

Impulse
We sometimes encounter examples where a large
force acts for a very short duration producing a
finite change in momentum of the body. For
example, when a ball hits a wall and bounces
back, the force on the ball by the wall acts for a
very short time when the two are in contact, yet
the force is large enough to reverse the momentum
of the ball. Often, in these situations, the force
and the time duration are difficult to ascertain
separately. However, the product of force and time,
which is the change in momentum of the body
remains a measurable quantity. This product is
called impulse:
Impulse = Force × time duration
= Change in momentum



(4.7)

⊳

56

PHYSICS

A large force acting for a short time to produce a
finite change in momentum is called an impulsive
force. In the history of science, impulsive forces were
put in a conceptually different category from
ordinary forces. Newtonian mechanics has no such
distinction. Impulsive force is like any other force –
except that it is large and acts for a short time.
Example 4.4 A batsman hits back a ball
straight in the direction of the bowler without
changing its initial speed of 12 m s–1.
If the mass of the ball is 0.15 kg, determine
the impulse imparted to the ball. (Assume
linear motion of the ball)

⊳

Answer Change in momentum
= 0.15 × 12–(–0.15×12)
= 3.6 N s,
Impulse = 3.6 N s,
in the direction from the batsman to the bowler.
This is an example where the force on the ball
by the batsman and the time of contact of the
ball and the bat are difficult to know, but the
impulse is readily calculated.
⊳

Thus, according to Newtonian mechanics,
force never occurs singly in nature. Force is the
mutual interaction between two bodies. Forces
always occur in pairs. Further, the mutual forces
between two bodies are always equal and
opposite. This idea was expressed by Newton in
the form of the third law of motion.
To every action, there is always an equal and
opposite reaction.
Newton’s wording of the third law is so crisp and
beautiful that it has become a part of common
language. For the same reason perhaps,
misconceptions about the third law abound. Let
us note some important points about the third
law, particularly in regard to the usage of the
terms : action and reaction.
1. The terms action and reaction in the third law
mean nothing else but ‘force’. Using different
terms for the same physical concept
can sometimes be confusing. A simple
and clear way of stating the third law is as
follows :
Forces always occur in pairs. Force on a
body A by B is equal and opposite to the
force on the body B by A.

4.6 NEWTON’S THIRD LAW OF MOTION
The second law relates the external force on a
body to its acceleration. What is the origin of the
external force on the body ? What agency
provides the external force ? The simple answer
in Newtonian mechanics is that the external
force on a body always arises due to some other
body. Consider a pair of bodies A and B. B gives
rise to an external force on A. A natural question
is: Does A in turn give rise to an external force
on B ? In some examples, the answer seems
clear. If you press a coiled spring, the spring is
compressed by the force of your hand. The
compressed spring in turn exerts a force on your
hand and you can feel it. But what if the bodies
are not in contact ? The earth pulls a stone
downwards due to gravity. Does the stone exert
a force on the earth ? The answer is not obvious
since we hardly see the effect of the stone on the
earth. The answer according to Newton is: Yes,
the stone does exert an equal and opposite force
on the earth. We do not notice it since the earth
is very massive and the effect of a small force on
its motion is negligible.

2. The terms action and reaction in the third law
may give a wrong impression that action
comes before reaction i.e action is the cause
and reaction the effect. There is no causeeffect relation implied in the third law. The
force on A by B and the force on B by A act
at the same instant. By the same reasoning,
any one of them may be called action and the
other reaction.
3. Action and reaction forces act on different
bodies, not on the same body. Consider a pair
of bodies A and B. According to the third law,



FAB = – FBA

(4.8)

(force on A by B) = – (force on B by A)
Thus if we are considering the motion of any
one body (A or B), only one of the two forces is
relevant. It is an error to add up the two forces
and claim that the net force is zero.
However, if you are considering the system
of two bodies as a whole, FAB and FBA are
internal forces of the system (A + B). They add
up to give a null force. Internal forces in a
body or a system of particles thus cancel away

LAWS OF MOTION

in pairs. This is an important fact that
enables the second law to be applicable to a
body or a system of particles (See Chapter 6).

Example 4.5 Two identical billiard balls
strike a rigid wall with the same speed but
at different angles, and get reflected without
any change in speed, as shown in Fig. 4.6.
What is (i) the direction of the force on the
wall due to each ball? (ii) the ratio of the
magnitudes of impulses imparted to the
balls by the wall ?

( )

The direction of impulse (and force) is the same
as in (a) and is normal to the wall along the
negative x direction. As before, using Newton’s
third law, the force on the wall due to the ball is
normal to the wall along the positive x direction.
The ratio of the magnitudes of the impulses
imparted to the balls in (a) and (b) is

Answer An instinctive answer to (i) might be
that the force on the wall in case (a) is normal to
the wall, while that in case (b) is inclined at 30°
to the normal. This answer is wrong. The force
on the wall is normal to the wall in both cases.
How to find the force on the wall? The trick is
to consider the force (or impulse) on the ball
due to the wall using the second law, and then
use the third law to answer (i). Let u be the speed
of each ball before and after collision with the
wall, and m the mass of each ball. Choose the x
and y axes as shown in the figure, and consider
the change in momentum of the ball in each
case :

Note, while px changes sign after collision, py

the force on the wall due to the ball is normal to

the wall is normal to the wall, along the negative
x-direction. Using Newton’s third law of motion,

4.7 CONSERVATION OF MOMENTUM
The second and third laws of motion lead to
an important consequence: the law of
conservation of momentum. Take a familiar
example. A bullet is fired from a gun. If the force
on the bullet by the gun is F, the force on the gun
by the bullet is – F, according to the third law.
The two forces act for a common interval of time
∆t. According to the second law, F ∆t is the change
in momentum of the bullet and – F ∆t is the
change in momentum of the gun. Since initially,
both are at rest, the change in momentum equals
the final momentum for each. Thus if pb is the
momentum of the bullet after firing and pg is the
recoil momentum of the gun, pg = – pb i.e. pb + pg
= 0. That is, the total momentum of the (bullet +
gun) system is conserved.
Thus in an isolated system (i.e. a system with
no external force), mutual forces between pairs
of particles in the system can cause momentum
change in individual particles, but since the
mutual forces for each pair are equal and
opposite, the momentum changes cancel in pairs
and the total momentum remains unchanged.
This fact is known as the law of conservation
of momentum :



58

PHYSICS

The total momentum of an isolated system of
interacting particles is conserved.
An important example of the application of the
law of conservation of momentum is the collision
of two bodies. Consider two bodies A and B, with
initial momenta pA and pB. The bodies collide,
get apart, with final momenta p′A and p′ B
respectively. By the Second Law
FAB ∆t = p′A − p A and

FBA ∆t = p′B − p B
(where we have taken a common interval of time
for both forces i.e. the time for which the two
bodies are in contact.)
Since FAB = − FBA by the third law,

p′A − p A = −( p′B − p B )
p′A + p′B = p A + p B

In other words, the resultant of any two forces
say F1 and F2, obtained by the parallelogram
law of forces must be equal and opposite to the
third force, F3. As seen in Fig. 4.7, the three
forces in equilibrium can be represented by the
sides of a triangle with the vector arrows taken
in the same sense. The result can be
generalised to any number of forces. A particle
is in equilibrium under the action of forces F1,
F2,... Fn if they can be represented by the sides
of a closed n-sided polygon with arrows directed
in the same sense.

(4.9)

which shows that the total final momentum of
the isolated system equals its initial momentum.
Notice that this is true whether the collision is
elastic or inelastic. In elastic collisions, there is
a second condition that the total initial kinetic
energy of the system equals the total final kinetic
energy (See Chapter 5).

Equation (4.11) implies that
F1x + F2x + F3x = 0
F1y + F2y + F3y = 0
F1z + F2z + F3z = 0

4.8 EQUILIBRIUM OF A PARTICLE
Equilibrium of a particle in mechanics refers to
the situation when the net external force on the
particle is zero.* According to the first law, this
means that, the particle is either at rest or in
uniform motion.
If two forces F1 and F2, act on a particle,
equilibrium requires
F1 = − F2

Example 4.6 See Fig. 4.8. A mass of 6 kg
is suspended by a rope of length 2 m
from the ceiling. A force of 50 N in the
horizontal direction is applied at the midpoint P of the rope, as shown. What is the
angle the rope makes with the vertical in
equilibrium ? (Take g = 10 m s-2). Neglect
the mass of the rope.

(4.10)

i.e. the two forces on the particle must be equal
and opposite. Equilibrium under three
concurrent forces F1, F2 and F3 requires that
the vector sum of the three forces is zero.
F1 + F2 + F3 = 0

(4.12)

where F1x, F1y and F1z are the components of F1
along x, y and z directions respectively.

T1 sin θ = 50 N

Note the answer does not depend on the length
of the rope (assumed massless) nor on the point
at which the horizontal force is applied.

4.9 COMMON FORCES IN MECHANICS
In mechanics, we encounter several kinds of
forces. The gravitational force is, of course,
pervasive. Every object on the earth experiences
the force of gravity due to the earth. Gravity also
governs the motion of celestial bodies. The
gravitational force can act at a distance without
the need of any intervening medium.
All the other forces common in mechanics are
contact forces.* As the name suggests, a contact
force on an object arises due to contact with some
other object: solid or fluid. When bodies are in
contact (e.g. a book resting on a table, a system
of rigid bodies connected by rods, hinges and

other types of supports), there are mutual
contact forces (for each pair of bodies) satisfying
the third law. The component of contact force
normal to the surfaces in contact is called
normal reaction. The component parallel to the
surfaces in contact is called friction. Contact
forces arise also when solids are in contact with
fluids. For example, for a solid immersed in a
fluid, there is an upward bouyant force equal to
the weight of the fluid displaced. The viscous
force, air resistance, etc are also examples of
contact forces (Fig. 4.9).
Two other common forces are tension in a
string and the force due to spring. When a spring
is compressed or extended by an external force,
a restoring force is generated. This force is
usually proportional to the compression or
elongation (for small displacements). The spring
force F is written as F = – k x where x is the
displacement and k is the force constant. The
negative sign denotes that the force is opposite
to the displacement from the unstretched state.
For an inextensible string, the force constant is
very high. The restoring force in a string is called
tension. It is customary to use a constant tension
T throughout the string. This assumption is true
for a string of negligible mass.
We learnt that there are four fundamental
forces in nature. Of these, the weak and strong
forces appear in domains that do not concern
us here. Only the gravitational and electrical
forces are relevant in the context of mechanics.
The different contact forces of mechanics
mentioned above fundamentally arise from
electrical forces. This may seem surprising

Fig. 4.9 Some examples of contact forces in mechanics.

* We are not considering, for simplicity, charged and magnetic bodies. For these, besides gravity, there are
electrical and magnetic non-contact forces.



60

PHYSICS

since we are talking of uncharged and nonmagnetic bodies in mechanics. At the microscopic
level, all bodies are made of charged constituents
(nuclei and electrons) and the various contact
forces arising due to elasticity of bodies, molecular
collisions and impacts, etc. can ultimately be
traced to the electrical forces between the charged
constituents of different bodies. The detailed
microscopic origin of these forces is, however,
complex and not useful for handling problems in
mechanics at the macroscopic scale. This is why
they are treated as different types of forces with
their characteristic properties determined
empirically.

exist by itself. When there is no applied force,
there is no static friction. It comes into play the
moment there is an applied force. As the applied
force F increases, fs also increases, remaining
equal and opposite to the applied force (up to a
certain limit), keeping the body at rest. Hence, it
is called static friction. Static friction opposes
impending motion. The term impending motion
means motion that would take place (but does
not actually take place) under the applied force,
if friction were absent.
We know from experience that as the applied
force exceeds a certain limit, the body begins to
move. It is found experimentally that the limiting

( )

value of static friction f s max is independent of

4.9.1 Friction
Let us return to the example of a body of mass m
at rest on a horizontal table. The force of gravity
(mg) is cancelled by the normal reaction force
(N) of the table. Now suppose a force F is applied
horizontally to the body. We know from
experience that a small applied force may not
be enough to move the body. But if the applied
force F were the only external force on the body,
it must move with acceleration F/m, however
small. Clearly, the body remains at rest because
some other force comes into play in the
horizontal direction and opposes the applied
force F, resulting in zero net force on the body.
This force fs parallel to the surface of the body in
contact with the table is known as frictional
force, or simply friction (Fig. 4.10(a)). The
subscript stands for static friction to distinguish
it from kinetic friction fk that we consider later
(Fig. 4.10(b)). Note that static friction does not

the area of contact and varies with the normal
force(N) approximately as :

(f )

= µs N

(4.13)
where µ s is a constant of proportionality
depending only on the nature of the surfaces in
contact. The constant µs is called the coefficient
of static friction. The law of static friction may
thus be written as
fs ≤ µs N
(4.14)
s

max

( )

If the applied force F exceeds f s max the body
begins to slide on the surface. It is found experimentally that when relative motion has started,
the frictional force decreases from the static

( )

maximum value f s max . Frictional force that
opposes relative motion between surfaces in
contact is called kinetic or sliding friction and is
denoted by fk . Kinetic friction, like static friction, is found to be independent of the area of
contact. Further, it is nearly independent of the
velocity. It satisfies a law similar to that for static
friction:
f k = µk N

Fig. 4.10 Static and sliding friction: (a) Impending
motion of the body is opposed by static
friction. When external force exceeds the
maximum limit of static friction, the body
begins to move. (b) Once the body is in
motion, it is subject to sliding or kinetic friction
which opposes relative motion between the
two surfaces in contact. Kinetic friction is
usually less than the maximum value of static
friction.

(4.15)

where µk′ the coefficient of kinetic friction,
depends only on the surfaces in contact. As
mentioned above, experiments show that µk is
less than µs . When relative motion has begun,
the acceleration of the body according to the
second law is ( F – fk )/m. For a body moving with
constant velocity, F = fk. If the applied force on
the body is removed, its acceleration is – fk /m
and it eventually comes to a stop.
The laws of friction given above do not have
the status of fundamental laws like those for
gravitational, electric and magnetic forces. They
are empirical relations that are only



LAWS OF MOTION

61

approximately true. Yet they are very useful in
practical calculations in mechanics.
Thus, when two bodies are in contact, each
experiences a contact force by the other. Friction,
by definition, is the component of the contact force
parallel to the surfaces in contact, which opposes
impending or actual relative motion between the
two surfaces. Note that it is not motion, but
relative motion that the frictional force opposes.
Consider a box lying in the compartment of a train
that is accelerating. If the box is stationary
relative to the train, it is in fact accelerating along
with the train. What forces cause the acceleration
of the box? Clearly, the only conceivable force in
the horizontal direction is the force of friction. If
there were no friction, the floor of the train would
slip by and the box would remain at its initial
position due to inertia (and hit the back side of
the train). This impending relative motion is
opposed by the static friction fs. Static friction
provides the same acceleration to the box as that
of the train, keeping it stationary relative to the
train.
Example 4.7 Determine the maximum
acceleration of the train in which a box
lying on its floor will remain stationary,
given that the co-efficient of static friction
between the box and the train’s floor is
0.15.

Answer The forces acting on a block of mass m
at rest on an inclined plane are (i) the weight
mg acting vertically downwards (ii) the normal
force N of the plane on the block, and (iii) the
static frictional force fs opposing the impending
motion. In equilibrium, the resultant of these
forces must be zero. Resolving the weight mg
along the two directions shown, we have
m g sin θ = fs , m g cos θ = N
As θ increases, the self-adjusting frictional force
fs increases until at θ = θmax, fs achieves its

( )

maximum value, f s max = µs N.
Therefore,
tan θmax = µs or θmax = tan–1 µs
When θ becomes just a little more than θmax ,
there is a small net force on the block and it
begins to slide. Note that θmax depends only on
µs and is independent of the mass of the block.

PHYSICS

Answer As the string is inextensible, and the
pully is smooth, the 3 kg block and the 20 kg
trolley both have same magnitude of
acceleration. Applying second law to motion of
the block (Fig. 4.12(b)),
30 – T = 3a
Apply the second law to motion of the trolley (Fig.
4.12(c)),
T – fk = 20 a.
Now
fk = µk N,
Here
µk = 0.04,
N = 20 x 10
= 200 N.
Thus the equation for the motion of the trolley is
T – 0.04 x 200 = 20 a
Or T – 8 = 20a.
These equations give a =
and T = 27.1 N.

Rolling friction
A body like a ring or a sphere rolling without
slipping over a horizontal plane will suffer no
friction, in principle. At every instant, there is
just one point of contact between the body and
the plane and this point has no motion relative
to the plane. In this ideal situation, kinetic or
static friction is zero and the body should
continue to roll with constant velocity. We know,
in practice, this will not happen and some
resistance to motion (rolling friction) does occur,
i.e. to keep the body rolling, some applied force
is needed. For the same weight, rolling friction
is much smaller (even by 2 or 3 orders of
magnitude) than static or sliding friction. This

is the reason why discovery of the wheel has
been a major milestone in human history.
Rolling friction again has a complex origin,
though somewhat different from that of static
and sliding friction. During rolling, the surfaces
in contact get momentarily deformed a little, and
this results in a finite area (not a point) of the
body being in contact with the surface. The net
effect is that the component of the contact force
parallel to the surface opposes motion.
We often regard friction as something
undesirable. In many situations, like in a
machine with different moving parts, friction
does have a negative role. It opposes relative
motion and thereby dissipates power in the form
of heat, etc. Lubricants are a way of reducing
kinetic friction in a machine. Another way is to
use ball bearings between two moving parts of a
machine [Fig. 4.13(a)]. Since the rolling friction
between ball bearings and the surfaces in
contact is very small, power dissipation is
reduced. A thin cushion of air maintained
between solid surfaces in relative motion is
another effective way of reducing friction
(Fig. 4.13(a)).
In many practical situations, however, friction
is critically needed. Kinetic friction that
dissipates power is nevertheless important for
quickly stopping relative motion. It is made use
of by brakes in machines and automobiles.
Similarly, static friction is important in daily
life. We are able to walk because of friction. It
is impossible for a car to move on a very slippery
road. On an ordinary road, the friction between
the tyres and the road provides the necessary
external force to accelerate the car.

4.10 CIRCULAR MOTION
We have seen in Chapter 4 that acceleration of
a body moving in a circle of radius R with uniform
speed v is v2/R directed towards the centre.
According to the second law, the force f providing
c
this acceleration is :

fc =

mv 2
R

is the static friction that provides the centripetal
acceleration. Static friction opposes the
impending motion of the car moving away from
the circle. Using equation (4.14) & (4.16) we get
the result
f =

mv 2
≤ µs N
R

(4.16)

where m is the mass of the body. This force
directed forwards the centre is called the
centripetal force. For a stone rotated in a circle
by a string, the centripetal force is provided by
the tension in the string. The centripetal force
for motion of a planet around the sun is the

µs RN

= µs Rg
[ ∵ N = mg]
m
which is independent of the mass of the car.
This shows that for a given value of µs and R,
there is a maximum speed of circular motion of
the car possible, namely
v2 ≤

v max = µs Rg

gravitational force on the planet due to the sun.
For a car taking a circular turn on a horizontal
road, the centripetal force is the force of friction.
The circular motion of a car on a flat and
banked road give interesting application of the
laws of motion.

Motion of a car on a banked road

Motion of a car on a level road
Three forces act on the car (Fig. 4.14(a):
(i)
The weight of the car, mg
(ii)
Normal reaction, N
(iii)
Frictional force, f
As there is no acceleration in the vertical
direction
N – mg = 0
N = mg
(4.17)
The centripetal force required for circular motion
is along the surface of the road, and is provided
by the component of the contact force between
road and the car tyres along the surface. This
by definition is the frictional force. Note that it

N cos θ = mg + f sin θ

We can reduce the contribution of friction to the
circular motion of the car if the road is banked
(Fig. 4.14(b)). Since there is no acceleration along
the vertical direction, the net force along this
direction must be zero. Hence,
(4.19a)

The centripetal force is provided by the horizontal
components of N and f.
N sin θ + f cos θ =

mv 2
R

(4.19b)

But f ≤ µs N
Thus to obtain v
we put
max
f = µs N .
Then Eqs. (4.19a) and (4.19b) become
N cos θ = mg + µs N sin θ



(4.20a)

64

PHYSICS

N sin θ + µs N cos θ = mv2/R
From Eq. (4.20a), we obtain

N=

Substituting value of N in Eq. (4.20b), we get


µs + tanθ  2
or v max =  Rg

1 – µs tanθ 


(4.21)

Comparing this with Eq. (4.18) we see that
maximum possible speed of a car on a banked
road is greater than that on a flat road.
For

µs = 0 in Eq. (4.21 ),
vo = ( R g tan θ ) ½

(4.22)

At this speed, frictional force is not needed at all
to provide the necessary centripetal force.
Driving at this speed on a banked road will cause
little wear and tear of the tyres. The same
equation also tells you that for v < vo, frictional
force will be up the slope and that a car can be
parked only if tan θ ≤ µs.
Example 4.10 A cyclist speeding at
18 km/h on a level road takes a sharp
circular turn of radius 3 m without reducing
the speed. The co-efficient of static friction
between the tyres and the road is 0.1. Will
the cyclist slip while taking the turn?

⊳

Answer On an unbanked road, frictional force
alone can provide the centripetal force needed
to keep the cyclist moving on a circular turn
without slipping. If the speed is too large, or if
the turn is too sharp (i.e. of too small a radius)
or both, the frictional force is not sufficient to
provide the necessary centripetal force, and the
cyclist slips. The condition for the cyclist not to
slip is given by Eq. (4.18) :
v 2 ≤ µs R g
Now, R = 3 m, g = 9.8 m s-2, µs = 0.1. That is,
µs R g = 2.94 m2 s-2. v = 18 km/h = 5 m s-1; i.e.,
v2 = 25 m2 s-2. The condition is not obeyed.
The cyclist will slip while taking the
circular turn.
⊳

⊳ Example 4.11 A circular racetrack of
radius 300 m is banked at an angle of 15°.
If the coefficient of friction between the
wheels of a race-car and the road is 0.2,
what is the (a) optimum speed of the racecar to avoid wear and tear on its tyres, and
(b) maximum permissible speed to avoid
slipping ?
Answer On a banked road, the horizontal
component of the normal force and the frictional
force contribute to provide centripetal force to
keep the car moving on a circular turn without
slipping. At the optimum speed, the normal
reaction’s component is enough to provide the
needed centripetal force, and the frictional force
is not needed. The optimum speed vo is given by
Eq. (4.22):
vO = (R g tan θ)1/2
Here R = 300 m, θ = 15°, g = 9.8 m s-2; we
have
vO = 28.1 m s-1.
The maximum permissible speed vmax is given by
Eq. (4.21):

4.11 SOLVING PROBLEMS IN MECHANICS
The three laws of motion that you have learnt in
this chapter are the foundation of mechanics.
You should now be able to handle a large variety
of problems in mechanics. A typical problem in
mechanics usually does not merely involve a
single body under the action of given forces.
More often, we will need to consider an assembly
of different bodies exerting forces on each other.
Besides, each body in the assembly experiences
the force of gravity. When trying to solve a
problem of this type, it is useful to remember
the fact that we can choose any part of the
assembly and apply the laws of motion to that
part provided we include all forces on the chosen
part due to the remaining parts of the assembly.
We may call the chosen part of the assembly as
the system and the remaining part of the
assembly (plus any other agencies of forces) as
the environment. We have followed the same



LAWS OF MOTION

65

method in solved examples. To handle a typical
problem in mechanics systematically, one
should use the following steps :
(i) Draw a diagram showing schematically the
various parts of the assembly of bodies, the
links, supports, etc.
(ii) Choose a convenient part of the assembly
as one system.
(iii) Draw a separate diagram which shows this
system and all the forces on the system by
the remaining part of the assembly. Include
also the forces on the system by other
agencies. Do not include the forces on the
environment by the system. A diagram of
this type is known as ‘a free-body diagram’.
(Note this does not imply that the system
under consideration is without a net force).
(iv) In a free-body diagram, include information
about forces (their magnitudes and
directions) that are either given or you are
sure of (e.g., the direction of tension in a
string along its length). The rest should be
treated as unknowns to be determined using
laws of motion.
(v) If necessary, follow the same procedure for
another choice of the system. In doing so,
employ Newton’s third law. That is, if in the
free-body diagram of A, the force on A due to
B is shown as F, then in the free-body
diagram of B, the force on B due to A should
be shown as –F.

the net force on the block must be zero i.e.,
R = 20 N. Using third law the action of the
block (i.e. the force exerted on the floor by
the block) is equal to 20 N and directed
vertically downwards.
(b) The system (block + cylinder) accelerates
downwards with 0.1 m s-2. The free-body
diagram of the system shows two forces on
the system : the force of gravity due to the
earth (270 N); and the normal force R ′ by the
floor. Note, the free-body diagram of the
system does not show the internal forces
between the block and the cylinder. Applying
the second law to the system,
270 – R′ = 27 × 0.1N
ie. R′ = 267.3 N

The following example illustrates the above
procedure :
⊳ Example 4.12 See Fig. 4.15. A wooden
block of mass 2 kg rests on a soft horizontal
floor. When an iron cylinder of mass 25 kg
is placed on top of the block, the floor yields
steadily and the block and the cylinder
together go down with an acceleration of
0.1 m s–2. What is the action of the block
on the floor (a) before and (b) after the floor
yields ? Take g = 10 m s–2. Identify the
action-reaction pairs in the problem.

Fig. 4.15

By the third law, the action of the system on
the floor is equal to 267.3 N vertically downward.

Action-reaction pairs

Answer
(a) The block is at rest on the floor. Its free-body
diagram shows two forces on the block, the
force of gravitational attraction by the earth
equal to 2 × 10 = 20 N; and the normal force
R of the floor on the block. By the First Law,

For (a): (i) the force of gravity (20 N) on the block
by the earth (say, action); the force of
gravity on the earth by the block
(reaction) equal to 20 N directed
upwards (not shown in the figure).
(ii) the force on the floor by the block
(action); the force on the block by the
floor (reaction).
For (b): (i) the force of gravity (270 N) on the
system by the earth (say, action); the
force of gravity on the earth by the
system (reaction), equal to 270 N,



66

PHYSICS

directed upwards (not shown in the
figure).
(ii) the force on the floor by the system
(action); the force on the system by the
floor (reaction). In addition, for (b), the
force on the block by the cylinder and
the force on the cylinder by the block
also constitute an action-reaction pair.
The important thing to remember is that an
action-reaction pair consists of mutual forces
which are always equal and opposite between
two bodies. Two forces on the same body which
happen to be equal and opposite can never
constitute an action-reaction pair. The force of

gravity on the mass in (a) or (b) and the normal
force on the mass by the floor are not actionreaction pairs. These forces happen to be equal
and opposite for (a) since the mass is at rest.
They are not so for case (b), as seen already.
The weight of the system is 270 N, while the
normal force R′ is 267.3 N.
⊳
The practice of drawing free-body diagrams is
of great help in solving problems in mechanics.
It allows you to clearly define your system and
consider all forces on the system due to objects
that are not part of the system itself. A number
of exercises in this and subsequent chapters will
help you cultivate this practice.

SUMMARY
1.
2.

3.
4.

Aristotle’s view that a force is necessary to keep a body in uniform motion is wrong. A
force is necessary in practice to counter the opposing force of friction.
Galileo extrapolated simple observations on motion of bodies on inclined planes, and
arrived at the law of inertia. Newton’s first law of motion is the same law rephrased
thus: “Everybody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line,
unless compelled by some external force to act otherwise”. In simple terms, the First Law
is “If external force on a body is zero, its acceleration is zero”.
Momentum (p ) of a body is the product of its mass (m) and velocity (v) :
p = mv
Newton’s second law of motion :
The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the applied force and takes
place in the direction in which the force acts. Thus

F=k

dp

=kma
dt
where F is the net external force on the body and a its acceleration. We set the constant
of proportionality k = 1 in SI units. Then
F=

dp

= ma
dt
The SI unit of force is newton : 1 N = 1 kg m s-2.
(a) The second law is consistent with the First Law (F = 0 implies a = 0)
(b) It is a vector equation
(c) It is applicable to a particle, and also to a body or a system of particles, provided F
is the total external force on the system and a is the acceleration of the system as
a whole.
(d) F at a point at a certain instant determines a at the same point at that instant.
That is the Second Law is a local law; a at an instant does not depend on the
history of motion.
4. Impulse is the product of force and time which equals change in momentum.
The notion of impulse is useful when a large force acts for a short time to produce a
measurable change in momentum. Since the time of action of the force is very short,
one can assume that there is no appreciable change in the position of the body during
the action of the impulsive force.
6. Newton’s third law of motion:
To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction



LAWS OF MOTION

8.

67

In simple terms, the law can be stated thus :
Forces in nature always occur between pairs of bodies. Force on a body A by body
B is equal and opposite to the force on the body B by A.
Action and reaction forces are simultaneous forces. There is no cause-effect
relation between action and reaction. Any of the two mutual forces can be
called action and the other reaction. Action and reaction act on different
bodies and so they cannot be cancelled out. The internal action and reaction
forces between different parts of a body do, however, sum to zero.
Law of Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum of an isolated system of particles is conserved. The law
follows from the second and third law of motion.
Friction
Frictional force opposes (impending or actual) relative motion between two
surfaces in contact. It is the component of the contact force along the common
tangent to the surface in contact. Static friction fs opposes impending relative
motion; kinetic friction fk opposes actual relative motion. They are independent
of the area of contact and satisfy the following approximate laws :

( )

f s ≤ fs
= µs R
max
=µ R

µs (co-efficient of static friction) and µk (co-efficient of kinetic friction) are
constants characteristic of the pair of surfaces in contact. It is found
experimentally that µk is less than µs .

Force is not always in the direction of motion. Depending on the situation, F
may be along v, opposite to v, normal to v or may make some other angle with
v. In every case, it is parallel to acceleration.
If v = 0 at an instant, i.e. if a body is momentarily at rest, it does not mean that
force or acceleration are necessarily zero at that instant. For example, when a
ball thrown upward reaches its maximum height, v = 0 but the force continues
to be its weight mg and the acceleration is not zero but g.
Force on a body at a given time is determined by the situation at the location of
the body at that time. Force is not ‘carried’ by the body from its earlier history of
motion. The moment after a stone is released out of an accelerated train, there is
no horizontal force (or acceleration) on the stone, if the effects of the surrounding
air are neglected. The stone then has only the vertical force of gravity.
In the second law of motion F = m a, F stands for the net force due to all
material agencies external to the body. a is the effect of the force. ma should
not be regarded as yet another force, besides F.



68

PHYSICS

5.

The centripetal force should not be regarded as yet another kind of force. It is
simply a name given to the force that provides inward radial acceleration to a
body in circular motion. We should always look for some material force like
tension, gravitational force, electrical force, friction, etc as the centripetal force
in any circular motion.
6. Static friction is a self-adjusting force up to its limit µs N (fs ≤ µs N). Do not put
fs= µs N without being sure that the maximum value of static friction is coming
into play.
7. The familiar equation mg = R for a body on a table is true only if the body is in
equilibrium. The two forces mg and R can be different (e.g. a body in an
accelerated lift). The equality of mg and R has no connection with the third
law.
8. The terms ‘action’ and ‘reaction’ in the third Law of Motion simply stand for
simultaneous mutual forces between a pair of bodies. Unlike their meaning in
ordinary language, action does not precede or cause reaction. Action and reaction
act on different bodies.
9. The different terms like ‘friction’, ‘normal reaction’ ‘tension’, ‘air resistance’,
‘viscous drag’, ‘thrust’, ‘buoyancy’, ‘weight’, ‘centripetal force’ all stand for ‘force’
in different contexts. For clarity, every force and its equivalent terms
encountered in mechanics should be reduced to the phrase ‘force on A by B’.
10. For applying the second law of motion, there is no conceptual distinction between
inanimate and animate objects. An animate object such as a human also
requires an external force to accelerate. For example, without the external
force of friction, we cannot walk on the ground.
11. The objective concept of force in physics should not be confused with the
subjective concept of the ‘feeling of force’. On a merry-go-around, all parts of
our body are subject to an inward force, but we have a feeling of being pushed
outward – the direction of impending motion.

The terms ‘work’, ‘energy’ and ‘power’ are frequently used
in everyday language. A farmer ploughing the field, a
construction worker carrying bricks, a student studying for
a competitive examination, an artist painting a beautiful
landscape, all are said to be working. In physics, however,
the word ‘Work’ covers a definite and precise meaning.
Somebody who has the capacity to work for 14-16 hours a
day is said to have a large stamina or energy. We admire a
long distance runner for her stamina or energy. Energy is
thus our capacity to do work. In Physics too, the term ‘energy’
is related to work in this sense, but as said above the term
‘work’ itself is defined much more precisely. The word ‘power’
is used in everyday life with different shades of meaning. In
karate or boxing we talk of ‘powerful’ punches. These are
delivered at a great speed. This shade of meaning is close to
the meaning of the word ‘power’ used in physics. We shall
find that there is at best a loose correlation between the
physical definitions and the physiological pictures these
terms generate in our minds. The aim of this chapter is to
develop an understanding of these three physical quantities.
Before we proceed to this task, we need to develop a
mathematical prerequisite, namely the scalar product of two
vectors.
5.1.1 The Scalar Product
We have learnt about vectors and their use in Chapter 3.
Physical quantities like displacement, velocity, acceleration,
force etc. are vectors. We have also learnt how vectors are
added or subtracted. We now need to know how vectors are
multiplied. There are two ways of multiplying vectors which
we shall come across : one way known as the scalar product
gives a scalar from two vectors and the other known as the
vector product produces a new vector from two vectors. We
shall look at the vector product in Chapter 6. Here we take
up the scalar product of two vectors. The scalar product or
dot product of any two vectors A and B, denoted as A.B (read



72

PHYSICS

A dot B) is defined as
A.B = A B cos θ

(5.1a)

where θ is the angle between the two vectors as
shown in Fig. 5.1(a). Since A, B and cos θ are
scalars, the dot product of A and B is a scalar
quantity. Each vector, A and B, has a direction
but their scalar product does not have a
direction.
From Eq. (5.1a), we have

B = B x iɵ + By ɵj + Bz kɵ

their scalar product is

(

= B (A cos θ )
Geometrically, B cos θ is the projection of B onto
A in Fig.5.1 (b) and A cos θ is the projection of A
onto B in Fig. 5.1 (c). So, A.B is the product of
the magnitude of A and the component of B along
A. Alternatively, it is the product of the
magnitude of B and the component of A along B.
Equation (5.1a) shows that the scalar product
follows the commutative law :
A.B = B.A
Scalar product obeys the distributive
law:
A . (B + C) = A .B + A .C
A. (λ B) = λ (A.B)

5.2 NOTIONS OF WORK AND KINETIC
ENERGY: THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM
The following relation for rectilinear motion under
constant acceleration a has been encountered
in Chapter 3,
v2 − u2 = 2 as
(5.2)
where u and v are the initial and final speeds
and s the distance traversed. Multiplying both
sides by m/2, we have

1
1
mv 2 − mu 2 = mas = Fs
2
2

to be proportional to the speed of the drop
but is otherwise undetermined. Consider
a drop of mass 1.00 g falling from a height
1.00 km. It hits the ground with a speed of
50.0 m s-1. (a) What is the work done by the
gravitational force ? What is the work done
by the unknown resistive force?
Answer (a) The change in kinetic energy of the
drop is

∆K =

(5.2a)

1
× 10-3 × 50 × 50
2
= 1.25 J

where the last step follows from Newton’s Second
Law. We can generalise Eq. (5.2) to three
dimensions by employing vectors
v2 − u2 = 2 a.d
Here a and d are acceleration and displacement
vectors of the object respectively.
Once again multiplying both sides by m/2 , we obtain

1
1
mv 2 − mu 2 = m a.d = F.d
(5.2b)
2
2
The above equation provides a motivation for
the definitions of work and kinetic energy. The
left side of the equation is the difference in the
quantity ‘half the mass times the square of the
speed’ from its initial value to its final value. We
call each of these quantities the ‘kinetic energy’,
denoted by K. The right side is a product of the
displacement and the component of the force
along the displacement. This quantity is called
‘work’ and is denoted by W. Eq. (5.2b) is then
Kf − Ki = W

(5.3)

where Ki and Kf are respectively the initial and
final kinetic energies of the object. Work refers
to the force and the displacement over which it
acts. Work is done by a force on the body over
a certain displacement.
Equation (5.2) is also a special case of the
work-energy (WE) theorem : The change in
kinetic energy of a particle is equal to the
work done on it by the net force. We shall
generalise the above derivation to a varying force
in a later section.
⊳ Example 5.2 It is well known that a
raindrop falls under the influence of the
downward gravitational force and the
opposing resistive force. The latter is known

1
m v2 − 0
2

=

where we have assumed that the drop is initially
at rest.
Assuming that g is a constant with a value
10 m/s2, the work done by the gravitational force
is,
Wg = mgh
= 10-3 ×10 ×103
= 10.0 J
(b) From the work-energy theorem
∆ K = W g + Wr

where Wr is the work done by the resistive force
on the raindrop. Thus
Wr = ∆K − Wg
= 1.25 −10
= − 8.75 J
is negative.

⊳

5.3 WORK
As seen earlier, work is related to force and the
displacement over which it acts. Consider a
constant force F acting on an object of mass m.
The object undergoes a displacement d in the
positive x-direction as shown in Fig. 5.2.

Fig. 5.2

An object undergoes a displacement d
under the influence of the force F.



74

PHYSICS

The work done by the force is defined to be
the product of component of the force in the
direction of the displacement and the
magnitude of this displacement. Thus
(5.4)

We see that if there is no displacement, there
is no work done even if the force is large. Thus,
when you push hard against a rigid brick wall,
the force you exert on the wall does no work. Yet
your muscles are alternatively contracting and
relaxing and internal energy is being used up
and you do get tired. Thus, the meaning of work
in physics is different from its usage in everyday
language.
No work is done if :
(i) the displacement is zero as seen in the
example above. A weightlifter holding a 150
kg mass steadily on his shoulder for 30 s
does no work on the load during this time.
(ii) the force is zero. A block moving on a smooth
horizontal table is not acted upon by a
horizontal force (since there is no friction), but
may undergo a large displacement.
(iii) the force and displacement are mutually
perpendicular. This is so since, for θ = π/2 rad
(= 90o), cos (π/2) = 0. For the block moving on
a smooth horizontal table, the gravitational
force mg does no work since it acts at right
angles to the displacement. If we assume that
the moon’s orbits around the earth is
perfectly circular then the earth’s
gravitational force does no work. The moon’s
instantaneous displacement is tangential
while the earth’s force is radially inwards and
θ = π/2.
Work can be both positive and negative. If θ is
between 0o and 90o, cos θ in Eq. (5.4) is positive.
If θ is between 90o and 180o, cos θ is negative.
In many examples the frictional force opposes
displacement and θ = 180o. Then the work done
by friction is negative (cos 180o = –1).
From Eq. (5.4) it is clear that work and energy
have the same dimensions, [ML2T–2]. The SI unit
of these is joule (J), named after the famous British
physicist James Prescott Joule (1811-1869). Since
work and energy are so widely used as physical
concepts, alternative units abound and some of
these are listed in Table 5.1.

⊳

W = (F cos θ )d = F.d

Table 5.1 Alternative Units of Work/Energy in J

Example 5.3 A cyclist comes to a skidding
stop in 10 m. During this process, the force
on the cycle due to the road is 200 N and
is directly opposed to the motion. (a) How
much work does the road do on the cycle ?
(b) How much work does the cycle do on
the road ?

Answer Work done on the cycle by the road is
the work done by the stopping (frictional) force
on the cycle due to the road.
(a) The stopping force and the displacement make
an angle of 180o (π rad) with each other.
Thus, work done by the road,
Wr = Fd cosθ
= 200 × 10 × cos π
= – 2000 J
It is this negative work that brings the cycle
to a halt in accordance with WE theorem.
(b) From Newton’s Third Law an equal and
opposite force acts on the road due to the
cycle. Its magnitude is 200 N. However, the
road undergoes no displacement. Thus,
work done by cycle on the road is zero.
⊳
The lesson of Example 5.3 is that though the
force on a body A exerted by the body B is always
equal and opposite to that on B by A (Newton’s
Third Law); the work done on A by B is not
necessarily equal and opposite to the work done
on B by A.

As noted earlier, if an object of mass m has
velocity v, its kinetic energy K is

K =

m v.v = mv 2

(5.5)

Kinetic energy is a scalar quantity. The kinetic
energy of an object is a measure of the work an

object can do by the virtue of its motion. This
notion has been intuitively known for a long time.
The kinetic energy of a fast flowing stream
has been used to grind corn. Sailing
ships employ the kinetic energy of the wind. Table
5.2 lists the kinetic energies for various
objects.
Example 5.4 In a ballistics demonstration
a police officer fires a bullet of mass 50.0 g
with speed 200 m s-1 (see Table 5.2) on soft
plywood of thickness 2.00 cm. The bullet
emerges with only 10% of its initial kinetic
energy. What is the emergent speed of the
bullet ?

This is illustrated in Fig. 5.3(a). Adding
successive rectangular areas in Fig. 5.3(a) we
get the total work done as
xf

W≅

⊳

where the summation is from the initial position
xi to the final position xf.
If the displacements are allowed to approach
zero, then the number of terms in the sum
increases without limit, but the sum approaches
a definite value equal to the area under the curve
in Fig. 5.3(b). Then the work done is
W =

Answer The initial kinetic energy of the bullet
is mv2/2 = 1000 J. It has a final kinetic energy
of 0.1×1000 = 100 J. If vf is the emergent speed
of the bullet,
1

∑F (x )∆x

where ‘lim’ stands for the limit of the sum when
∆x tends to zero. Thus, for a varying force
the work done can be expressed as a definite
integral of force over displacement (see also
Appendix 3.1).

The speed is reduced by approximately 68%
(not 90%).
⊳
5.5 WORK DONE BY A VARIABLE FORCE
A constant force is rare. It is the variable force,
which is more commonly encountered. Fig. 5.3
is a plot of a varying force in one dimension.
If the displacement ∆x is small, we can take
the force F (x) as approximately constant and
the work done is then
∆W =F (x) ∆x

PHYSICS

The work done by the frictional force is
Wf → area of the rectangle AGHI
Wf = (−50) × 20

The area on the negative side of the force axis
has a negative sign.

5.6 THE WORK-ENERGY THEOREM FOR A
VARIABLE FORCE
Fig. 5.3 (a) The shaded rectangle represents the
work done by the varying force F(x), over
the small displacement ∆x, ∆W = F(x) ∆x.
(b) adding the areas of all the rectangles we
find that for ∆x → 0, the area under the curve
is exactly equal to the work done by F(x).

Example 5.5 A woman pushes a trunk on
a railway platform which has a rough
surface. She applies a force of 100 N over a
distance of 10 m. Thereafter, she gets
progressively tired and her applied force
reduces linearly with distance to 50 N. The
total distance through which the trunk has
been moved is 20 m. Plot the force applied
by the woman and the frictional force, which
is 50 N versus displacement. Calculate the
work done by the two forces over 20 m.

We are now familiar with the concepts of work
and kinetic energy to prove the work-energy
theorem for a variable force. We confine
ourselves to one dimension. The time rate of
change of kinetic energy is

The plot of the applied force is shown in Fig.
5.4. At x = 20 m, F = 50 N (≠ 0). We are given
that the frictional force f is |f|= 50 N. It opposes
motion and acts in a direction opposite to F. It
is therefore, shown on the negative side of the
force axis.

From Eq. (5.7), it follows that
Kf − Ki = W

(5.8b)

Thus, the WE theorem is proved for a variable
force.
While the WE theorem is useful in a variety of
problems, it does not, in general, incorporate the
complete dynamical information of Newton’s
second law. It is an integral form of Newton’s
second law. Newton’s second law is a relation
between acceleration and force at any instant of
time. Work-energy theorem involves an integral
over an interval of time. In this sense, the temporal
(time) information contained in the statement of
Newton’s second law is ‘integrated over’ and is



WORK, ENERGY AND POWER

77

not available explicitly. Another observation is that
Newton’s second law for two or three dimensions
is in vector form whereas the work-energy
theorem is in scalar form. In the scalar form,
information with respect to directions contained
in Newton’s second law is not present.

Example 5.6 A block of mass m = 1 kg,
moving on a horizontal surface with speed

are like ‘compressed springs’. They possess a
large amount of potential energy. An earthquake
results when these fault lines readjust. Thus,
potential energy is the ‘stored energy’ by virtue
of the position or configuration of a body. The
body left to itself releases this stored energy in
the form of kinetic energy. Let us make our notion
of potential energy more concrete.
The gravitational force on a ball of mass m is
mg . g may be treated as a constant near the earth
surface. By ‘near’ we imply that the height h of
the ball above the earth’s surface is very small
compared to the earth’s radius RE (h <<RE) so that
we can ignore the variation of g near the earth’s
surface*. In what follows we have taken the
upward direction to be positive. Let us raise the
ball up to a height h. The work done by the external
agency against the gravitational force is mgh. This
work gets stored as potential energy.
Gravitational potential energy of an object, as a
function of the height h, is denoted by V(h) and it
is the negative of work done by the gravitational
force in raising the object to that height.
V (h) = mgh
If h is taken as a variable, it is easily seen that
the gravitational force F equals the negative of
the derivative of V(h) with respect to h. Thus,

d
V(h) = −m g
dh
The negative sign indicates that the
gravitational force is downward. When released,
the ball comes down with an increasing speed.
Just before it hits the ground, its speed is given
by the kinematic relation,
v2 = 2gh
This equation can be written as
F =−

1
= mvi2 − k ln (2.01/0.1)
2
= 2 − 0.5 ln (20.1)
= 2 − 1.5 = 0.5 J
v f = 2K f /m = 1 m s−1

Here, note that ln is a symbol for the natural
logarithm to the base e and not the logarithm to
the base 10 [ln X = loge X = 2.303 log10 X].
⊳
5.7 THE CONCEPT OF POTENTIAL ENERGY
The word potential suggests possibility or
capacity for action. The term potential energy
brings to one’s mind ‘stored’ energy. A stretched
bow-string possesses potential energy. When it
is released, the arrow flies off at a great speed.
The earth’s crust is not uniform, but has
discontinuities and dislocations that are called
fault lines. These fault lines in the earth’s crust

1
m v2 = m g h
2
which shows that the gravitational potential
energy of the object at height h, when the object
is released, manifests itself as kinetic energy of
the object on reaching the ground.
Physically, the notion of potential energy is
applicable only to the class of forces where work
done against the force gets ‘stored up’ as energy.
When external constraints are removed, it
manifests itself as kinetic energy. Mathematically,
(for simplicity, in one dimension) the potential

* The variation of g with height is discussed in Chapter 7 on Gravitation.

energy V(x) is defined if the force F(x) can be
written as

F (x ) = −

dV
dx

This implies that
xf

Vi

∫ F(x)dx = − ∫ dV = Vi − V f

The work done by a conservative force such as
gravity depends on the initial and final positions
only. In the previous chapter we have worked
on examples dealing with inclined planes. If an
object of mass m is released from rest, from the
top of a smooth (frictionless) inclined plane of
height h, its speed at the bottom
is 2gh irrespective of the angle of inclination.
Thus, at the bottom of the inclined plane it
acquires a kinetic energy, mgh. If the work done
or the kinetic energy did depend on other factors
such as the velocity or the particular path taken
by the object, the force would be called nonconservative.
The dimensions of potential energy are
[ML2T –2] and the unit is joule (J), the same as
kinetic energy or work. To reiterate, the change
in potential energy, for a conservative force,
∆V is equal to the negative of the work done by
the force
(5.9)
∆V = − F(x) ∆x
In the example of the falling ball considered in
this section we saw how potential energy was
converted to kinetic energy. This hints at an
important principle of conservation in mechanics,
which we now proceed to examine.

which means that K + V, the sum of the kinetic
and potential energies of the body is a constant.
Over the whole path, xi to xf, this means that
Ki + V(xi ) = Kf + V(xf )
(5.11)
The quantity K +V(x), is called the total
mechanical energy of the system. Individually
the kinetic energy K and the potential energy
V(x) may vary from point to point, but the sum
is a constant. The aptness of the term
‘conservative force’ is now clear.
Let us consider some of the definitions of a
conservative force.
l
A force F(x) is conservative if it can be derived
from a scalar quantity V(x) by the relation
given by Eq. (5.9). The three-dimensional
generalisation requires the use of a vector
derivative, which is outside the scope of this
book.
l
The work done by the conservative force
depends only on the end points. This can be
seen from the relation,
W = Kf – Ki = V (xi ) – V(xf )
which depends on the end points.
l
A third definition states that the work done
by this force in a closed path is zero. This is
once again apparent from Eq. (5.11) since
xi = xf .
Thus, the principle of conservation of total
mechanical energy can be stated as

5.8 THE CONSERVATION OF MECHANICAL
ENERGY

The total mechanical energy of a system is
conserved if the forces, doing work on it, are
conservative.
The above discussion can be made more
concrete by considering the example of the
gravitational force once again and that of the
spring force in the next section. Fig. 5.5 depicts
a ball of mass m being dropped from a cliff of
height H.

For simplicity we demonstrate this important
principle for one-dimensional motion. Suppose
that a body undergoes displacement ∆x under
the action of a conservative force F. Then from
the WE theorem we have,
∆K = F(x) ∆x
If the force is conservative, the potential energy
function V(x) can be defined such that
− ∆V = F(x) ∆x
The above equations imply that
∆K + ∆V = 0
∆(K + V ) = 0

Answer (i) There are two external forces on
the bob : gravity and the tension (T ) in the
string. The latter does no work since the
displacement of the bob is always normal to the
string. The potential energy of the bob is thus
associated with the gravitational force only. The
total mechanical energy E of the system is
conserved. We take the potential energy of the
system to be zero at the lowest point A. Thus,
at A :

a result that was obtained in section 5.7 for a

Further,
EH = Eh
which implies,
v 2h = 2 g(H − h)

where TA is the tension in the string at A. At the
highest point C, the string slackens, as the
tension in the string (TC ) becomes zero.

At the height H, the energy is purely potential.
It is partially converted to kinetic at height h and

the conservation of mechanical energy.

At point C, the string becomes slack and the

bob will execute a projectile motion with
horizontal projection akin to a rock kicked
horizontally from the edge of a cliff. Otherwise
the bob will continue on its circular path and
complete the revolution.

5.9 THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF A SPRING
The spring force is an example of a variable force
which is conservative. Fig. 5.7 shows a block
attached to a spring and resting on a smooth
horizontal surface. The other end of the spring
is attached to a rigid wall. The spring is light
and may be treated as massless. In an ideal
spring, the spring force Fs is proportional to
x where x is the displacement of the block from
the equilibrium position. The displacement could
be either positive [Fig. 5.7(b)] or negative
[Fig. 5.7(c)]. This force law for the spring is called
Hooke’s law and is mathematically stated as
Fs = − kx
The constant k is called the spring constant. Its
unit is N m-1. The spring is said to be stiff if k is
large and soft if k is small.
Suppose that we pull the block outwards as in
Fig. 5.7(b). If the extension is xm, the work done by
the spring force is
xm

Ws = ∫ Fs dx
0

=−

2
k xm

= − ∫ kx dx

(5.15)

This expression may also be obtained by
considering the area of the triangle as in
Fig. 5.7(d). Note that the work done by the
external pulling force F is positive since it
overcomes the spring force.

Fig. 5.7 Illustration of the spring force with a block
attached to the free end of the spring.
(a) The spring force Fs is zero when the
displacement x from the equilibrium position
is zero. (b) For the stretched spring x > 0
and Fs < 0 (c) For the compressed spring
x < 0 and Fs > 0.(d) The plot of Fs versus x.
The area of the shaded triangle represents
the work done by the spring force. Due to the
opposing signs of Fs and x, this work done is
2
negative, Ws = −kx m
/ 2.

The same is true when the spring is
compressed with a displacement xc (< 0). The
spring force does work Ws = − kx c2 / 2 while the



WORK, ENERGY AND POWER

81

external force F does work + kx c2 / 2 . If the block
is moved from an initial displacement xi to a
final displacement xf , the work done by the
spring force Ws is

and vice versa, however, the total mechanical
energy remains constant. This is graphically
depicted in Fig. 5.8.

Thus the work done by the spring force depends
only on the end points. Specifically, if the block
is pulled from xi and allowed to return to xi ;

(5.18)
The work done by the spring force in a cyclic
process is zero. We have explicitly demonstrated
that the spring force (i) is position dependent
only as first stated by Hooke, (Fs = − kx); (ii)
does work which only depends on the initial and
final positions, e.g. Eq. (5.17). Thus, the spring
force is a conservative force.
We define the potential energy V(x) of the spring
to be zero when block and spring system is in the
equilibrium position. For an extension (or
compression) x the above analysis suggests that

kx 2
(5.19)

You may easily verify that − dV/dx = − k x, the
spring force. If the block of mass m in Fig. 5.7 is
extended to xm and released from rest, then its
total mechanical energy at any arbitrary point x,
where x lies between – xm and + xm, will be given by

Example 5.8 To simulate car accidents, auto
manufacturers study the collisions of moving
cars with mounted springs of different spring
constants. Consider a typical simulation with
a car of mass 1000 kg moving with a speed
18.0 km/h on a smooth road and colliding
with a horizontally mounted spring of spring
constant 5.25 × 103 N m–1. What is the
maximum compression of the spring ?

energy of the car is converted entirely into the
potential energy of the spring.

At maximum compression x m, the potential
energy V of the spring is equal to the kinetic
energy K of the moving car from the principle of
conservation of mechanical energy.

We obtain

We note that we have idealised the situation.
The spring is considered to be massless. The
surface has been considered to possess
negligible friction.
⊳
We conclude this section by making a few
remarks on conservative forces.
(i) Information on time is absent from the above
discussions. In the example considered
above, we can calculate the compression, but
not the time over which the compression
occurs. A solution of Newton’s Second Law
for this system is required for temporal
information.
(ii) Not all forces are conservative. Friction, for
example, is a non-conservative force. The
principle of conservation of energy will have
to be modified in this case. This is illustrated
in Example 5.9.
(iii) The zero of the potential energy is arbitrary.
It is set according to convenience. For the
spring force we took V(x) = 0, at x = 0, i.e. the
unstretched spring had zero potential
energy. For the constant gravitational force
mg, we took V = 0 on the earth’s surface. In
a later chapter we shall see that for the force
due to the universal law of gravitation, the
zero is best defined at an infinite distance
from the gravitational source. However, once
the zero of the potential energy is fixed in a
given discussion, it must be consistently
adhered to throughout the discussion. You
cannot change horses in midstream !
Example 5.9 Consider Example 5.8 taking
the coefficient of friction, µ, to be 0.5 and
calculate the maximum compression of the
spring.

⊳

Answer In presence of friction, both the spring
force and the frictional force act so as to oppose
the compression of the spring as shown in
Fig. 5.9.
We invoke the work-energy theorem, rather
than the conservation of mechanical energy.
The change in kinetic energy is

Now µmg = 0.5 × 103 × 10 = 5 × 103 N (taking
g =10.0 m s -2). After rearranging the above
equation we obtain the following quadratic
equation in the unknown xm.

k x m2 + 2µm g x m − m v 2 = 0

where we take the positive square root since
xm is positive. Putting in numerical values we
obtain
xm = 1.35 m
which, as expected, is less than the result in
Example 5.8.
If the two forces on the body consist of a
conservative force Fc and a non-conservative
force Fnc , the conservation of mechanical energy
formula will have to be modified. By the WE
theorem
(Fc+ Fnc ) ∆x = ∆K
But
Fc ∆x = − ∆V
Hence,
∆(K + V) = Fnc ∆x
∆E = Fnc ∆x
where E is the total mechanical energy. Over
the path this assumes the form
Ef − Ei = Wnc
where W nc is the total work done by the
non-conservative forces over the path. Note that



WORK, ENERGY AND POWER

unlike the conservative force, Wnc depends on
the particular path i to f.
⊳
5.10 POWER
Often it is interesting to know not only the work
done on an object, but also the rate at which
this work is done. We say a person is physically
fit if he not only climbs four floors of a building
but climbs them fast. Power is defined as the
time rate at which work is done or energy is
transferred.
The average power of a force is defined as the
ratio of the work, W, to the total time t taken

also be expressed as

P = F.

the elevator in watts as well as in horse
power.

where v is the instantaneous velocity when the
force is F.
Power, like work and energy, is a scalar
quantity. Its dimensions are [ML2T – 3]. In the SI,
its unit is called a watt (W). The watt is 1 J s–1.
The unit of power is named after James Watt,
one of the innovators of the steam engine in the
eighteenth century.
There is another unit of power, namely the
horse-power (hp)
1 hp = 746 W
This unit is still used to describe the output of
automobiles, motorbikes, etc.
We encounter the unit watt when we buy
electrical goods such as bulbs, heaters and
refrigerators. A 100 watt bulb which is on for 10
hours uses 1 kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy.
100 (watt) × 10 (hour)
= 1000 watt hour
=1 kilowatt hour (kWh)
= 103 (W) × 3600 (s)
= 3.6 × 106 J

The motor must supply enough power to balance
this force. Hence,
P = F. v = 22000 × 2 = 44000 W = 59 hp

5.11 COLLISIONS
In physics we study motion (change in position).
At the same time, we try to discover physical
quantities, which do not change in a physical
process. The laws of momentum and energy
conservation are typical examples. In this
section we shall apply these laws to a commonly
encountered phenomena, namely collisions.
Several games such as billiards, marbles or
carrom involve collisions.We shall study the
collision of two masses in an idealised form.
Consider two masses m1 and m2. The particle
m1 is moving with speed v1i , the subscript ‘i’
implying initial. We can cosider m2 to be at rest.
No loss of generality is involved in making such
a selection. In this situation the mass m 1
collides with the stationary mass m2 and this
is depicted in Fig. 5.10.

Fig. 5.10 Collision of mass m1, with a stationary mass m2.

The masses m 1 and m 2 fly-off in different
directions. We shall see that there are
relationships, which connect the masses, the
velocities and the angles.

PHYSICS

5.11.1 Elastic and Inelastic Collisions
In all collisions the total linear momentum is
conserved; the initial momentum of the system
is equal to the final momentum of the system.
One can argue this as follows. When two objects
collide, the mutual impulsive forces acting over
the collision time ∆t cause a change in their
respective momenta :

The loss in kinetic energy on collision is
∆K =

=

1
1
m12
m1v12i −
v12i
2
2 m1 + m 2

∆p1 = F12 ∆t
∆p2 = F21 ∆t
where F12 is the force exerted on the first particle
by the second particle. F21 is likewise the force
exerted on the second particle by the first particle.
Now from Newton’s third law, F12 = − F21. This
implies
∆p1 + ∆p2 = 0
The above conclusion is true even though the
forces vary in a complex fashion during the
collision time ∆t. Since the third law is true at
every instant, the total impulse on the first object
is equal and opposite to that on the second.
On the other hand, the total kinetic energy of
the system is not necessarily conserved. The
impact and deformation during collision may
generate heat and sound. Part of the initial kinetic
energy is transformed into other forms of energy.
A useful way to visualise the deformation during
collision is in terms of a ‘compressed spring’. If
the ‘spring’ connecting the two masses regains
its original shape without loss in energy, then
the initial kinetic energy is equal to the final
kinetic energy but the kinetic energy during the
collision time ∆t is not constant. Such a collision
is called an elastic collision. On the other hand
the deformation may not be relieved and the two
bodies could move together after the collision. A
collision in which the two particles move together
after the collision is called a completely inelastic
collision. The intermediate case where the
deformation is partly relieved and some of the
initial kinetic energy is lost is more common and
is appropriately called an inelastic collision.

Consider next an elastic collision. Using the

momentum and kinetic energy conservation
equations are
m1v1i = m1v1f + m2v2f

(5.23)

m 1v12i = m 1v12f + m 2v 22 f

(5.24)

From Eqs. (5.23) and (5.24) it follows that,
m 1v1i (v 2 f − v1i ) = m1v1 f (v 2 f − v1 f )

v 2 f (v1i − v1 f ) = v12i − v12f

or,

= (v1i − v1 f )(v1i + v1 f )

Hence,

∴ v 2 f = v1i + v1 f

and causing it to fission. Show that a
neutron can lose most of its kinetic energy
in an elastic collision with a light nuclei
like deuterium or carbon which has a mass
of only a few times the neutron mass. The
material making up the light nuclei, usually
heavy water (D2O) or graphite, is called a
moderator.

Fig. 5.10 also depicts the collision of a moving
mass m1 with the stationary mass m2. Linear
momentum is conserved in such a collision.
Since momentum is a vector this implies three
equations for the three directions {x, y, z}.
Consider the plane determined by the final
velocity directions of m1 and m2 and choose it to
be the x-y plane. The conservation of the
z-component of the linear momentum implies
that the entire collision is in the x-y plane. The
x- and y-component equations are

We obtain an additional equation. That still
leaves us one equation short. At least one of
the four unknowns, say θ 1, must be made known
for the problem to be solvable. For example, θ1
can be determined by moving a detector in an
angular fashion from the x to the y axis. Given
{m1, m2, v1i , θ1} we can determine {v1f , v2f , θ2}
from Eqs. (5.28)-(5.30).

One can also verify this result by substituting
from Eq. (5.27).
For deuterium m 2 = 2m 1 and we obtain
f1 = 1/9 while f2 = 8/9. Almost 90% of the
neutron’s energy is transferred to deuterium. For
carbon f1 = 71.6% and f2 = 28.4%. In practice,
however, this number is smaller since head-on
collisions are rare.
⊳
If the initial velocities and final velocities of
both the bodies are along the same straight line,
then it is called a one-dimensional collision, or
head-on collision. In the case of small spherical
bodies, this is possible if the direction of travel
of body 1 passes through the centre of body 2
which is at rest. In general, the collision is two-

(5.30)

Example 5.12 Consider the collision
depicted in Fig. 5.10 to be between two
billiard balls with equal masses m1 = m2.
The first ball is called the cue while the
second ball is called the target. The
billiard player wants to ‘sink’ the target
ball in a corner pocket, which is at an
angle θ2 = 37°. Assume that the collision is
elastic and that friction and rotational
motion are not important. Obtain θ 1.

Answer From momentum conservation, since
the masses are equal

v1i = v1f + v 2f
or

(

v 1i 2 = v1 f + v 2 f ⋅ v1 f + v 2 f

+ v 2 f 2 + 2v1 f v 2 f cos (θ1 + 37° )

Since the collision is elastic and m1 = m2 it follows
from conservation of kinetic energy that
v1i 2 = v1 f 2 + v 2 f 2

(5.32)

Comparing Eqs. (5.31) and (5.32), we get
cos (θ1 + 37°) = 0
or

θ1 + 37° = 90°

Thus, θ1 = 53°
This proves the following result : when two equal
masses undergo a glancing elastic collision with
one of them at rest, after the collision, they will
move at right angles to each other.
⊳

The matter simplifies greatly if we consider
spherical masses with smooth surfaces, and
assume that collision takes place only when the
bodies touch each other. This is what happens
in the games of marbles, carrom and billiards.
In our everyday world, collisions take place only
when two bodies touch each other. But consider
a comet coming from far distances to the sun, or
alpha particle coming towards a nucleus and
going away in some direction. Here we have to
deal with forces involving action at a distance.
Such an event is called scattering. The velocities
and directions in which the two particles go away
depend on their initial velocities as well as the
type of interaction between them, their masses,
shapes and sizes.

SUMMARY

The work-energy theorem states that the change in kinetic energy of a body is the work
done by the net force on the body.
Kf - Ki = Wnet
A force is conservative if (i) work done by it on an object is path independent and
depends only on the end points {xi, xj}, or (ii) the work done by the force is zero for an
arbitrary closed path taken by the object such that it returns to its initial position.
For a conservative force in one dimension, we may define a potential energy function V(x)
such that

The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that the total mechanical
energy of a body remains constant if the only forces that act on the body are conservative.
The gravitational potential energy of a particle of mass m at a height x about the earth’s
surface is
V(x) = m g x
where the variation of g with height is ignored.

quantity given by :A.B = AB cos θ, where θ is the angle between A and B. It can be
positive, negative or zero depending upon the value of θ. The scalar product of two
vectors can be interpreted as the product of magnitude of one vector and component
of the other vector along the first vector. For unit vectors :

The phrase ‘calculate the work done’ is incomplete. We should refer (or imply
clearly by context) to the work done by a specific force or a group of forces on a
given body over a certain displacement.
Work done is a scalar quantity. It can be positive or negative unlike mass and
kinetic energy which are positive scalar quantities. The work done by the friction
or viscous force on a moving body is negative.
For two bodies, the sum of the mutual forces exerted between them is zero from
Newton’s Third Law,
F12 + F21 = 0

However, it may sometimes be true.
The work done by a force can be calculated sometimes even if the exact nature of
the force is not known. This is clear from Example 5.2 where the WE theorem is
used in such a situation.
The WE theorem is not independent of Newton’s Second Law. The WE theorem
may be viewed as a scalar form of the Second Law. The principle of conservation
of mechanical energy may be viewed as a consequence of the WE theorem for
conservative forces.
The WE theorem holds in all inertial frames. It can also be extended to noninertial frames provided we include the pseudoforces in the calculation of the
net force acting on the body under consideration.
The potential energy of a body subjected to a conservative force is always
undetermined upto a constant. For example, the point where the potential
energy is zero is a matter of choice. For the gravitational potential energy mgh,
the zero of the potential energy is chosen to be the ground. For the spring
potential energy kx2/2 , the zero of the potential energy is the equilibrium position
of the oscillating mass.
Every force encountered in mechanics does not have an associated potential
energy. For example, work done by friction over a closed path is not zero and no
potential energy can be associated with friction.
During a collision : (a) the total linear momentum is conserved at each instant of
the collision ; (b) the kinetic energy conservation (even if the collision is elastic)
applies after the collision is over and does not hold at every instant of the collision.
In fact the two colliding objects are deformed and may be momentarily at rest
with respect to each other.

Summary

Exercises

In the earlier chapters we primarily considered the motion
of a single particle. (A particle is ideally represented as a
point mass having no size.) We applied the results of our
study even to the motion of bodies of finite size, assuming
that motion of such bodies can be described in terms of the
motion of a particle.
Any real body which we encounter in daily life has a
finite size. In dealing with the motion of extended bodies
(bodies of finite size) often the idealised model of a particle is
inadequate. In this chapter we shall try to go beyond this
inadequacy. We shall attempt to build an understanding of
the motion of extended bodies. An extended body, in the
first place, is a system of particles. We shall begin with the
consideration of motion of the system as a whole. The centre
of mass of a system of particles will be a key concept here.
We shall discuss the motion of the centre of mass of a system
of particles and usefulness of this concept in understanding
the motion of extended bodies.
A large class of problems with extended bodies can be
solved by considering them to be rigid bodies. Ideally a
rigid body is a body with a perfectly definite and
unchanging shape. The distances between all pairs of
particles of such a body do not change. It is evident from
this definition of a rigid body that no real body is truly rigid,
since real bodies deform under the influence of forces. But in
many situations the deformations are negligible. In a number
of situations involving bodies such as wheels, tops, steel
beams, molecules and planets on the other hand, we can ignore
that they warp (twist out of shape), bend or vibrate and treat
them as rigid.
6.1.1 What kind of motion can a rigid body have?
Let us try to explore this question by taking some examples
of the motion of rigid bodies. Let us begin with a rectangular



SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

Fig 6.1 Translational (sliding) motion of a block down
an inclined plane.
(Any point like P1 or P2 of the block moves
with the same velocity at any instant of time.)

93

most common way to constrain a rigid body so
that it does not have translational motion is to
fix it along a straight line. The only possible
motion of such a rigid body is rotation. The line
or fixed axis about which the body is rotating is
its axis of rotation. If you look around, you will
come across many examples of rotation about
an axis, a ceiling fan, a potter’s wheel, a giant
wheel in a fair, a merry-go-round and so on (Fig
6.3(a) and (b)).

block sliding down an inclined plane without any
sidewise movement. The block is taken as a rigid
body. Its motion down the plane is such that all
the particles of the body are moving together,
i.e. they have the same velocity at any instant
of time. The rigid body here is in pure
translational motion (Fig. 6.1).
In pure translational motion at any
instant of time, all particles of the body have
the same velocity.
Consider now the rolling motion of a solid
metallic or wooden cylinder down the same
inclined plane (Fig. 6.2). The rigid body in this
problem, namely the cylinder, shifts from the
top to the bottom of the inclined plane, and thus,
seems to have translational motion. But as Fig.
6.2 shows, all its particles are not moving with
the same velocity at any instant. The body,
therefore, is not in pure translational motion.
Its motion is translational plus ‘something else.’

Fig. 6.2 Rolling motion of a cylinder. It is not pure
translational motion. Points P1, P2, P3 and P4
have different velocities (shown by arrows)
at any instant of time. In fact, the velocity of
the point of contact P3 is zero at any instant,
if the cylinder rolls without slipping.

In order to understand what this ‘something
else’ is, let us take a rigid body so constrained
that it cannot have translational motion. The

Let us try to understand what rotation is,
what characterises rotation. You may notice that
in rotation of a rigid body about a fixed axis,

PHYSICS

Fig. 6.5 (a) A spinning top
(The point of contact of the top with the
ground, its tip O, is fixed.)

Axis of oscillation

Fig. 6.4

A rigid body rotation about the z-axis (Each
point of the body such as P 1 or
P2 describes a circle with its centre (C1
or C2) on the axis of rotation. The radius of
the circle (r1or r 2 ) is the perpendicular
distance of the point (P1 or P2 ) from the
axis. A point on the axis like P3 remains
stationary).

every particle of the body moves in a circle,
which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis
and has its centre on the axis. Fig. 6.4 shows
the rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed
axis (the z-axis of the frame of reference). Let P1
be a particle of the rigid body, arbitrarily chosen
and at a distance r1 from fixed axis. The particle
P1 describes a circle of radius r1 with its centre
C1 on the fixed axis. The circle lies in a plane
perpendicular to the axis. The figure also shows
another particle P2 of the rigid body, P2 is at a
distance r2 from the fixed axis. The particle P2
moves in a circle of radius r2 and with centre C2
on the axis. This circle, too, lies in a plane
perpendicular to the axis. Note that the circles
described by P1 and P2 may lie in different planes;
both these planes, however, are perpendicular
to the fixed axis. For any particle on the axis
like P 3 , r = 0. Any such particle remains
stationary while the body rotates. This is
expected since the axis of rotation is fixed.

Axis of
rotation
from blades

Fig. 6.5 (b) An oscillating table fan with rotating
blades. The pivot of the fan, point O, is
fixed. The blades of the fan are under
rotational motion, whereas, the axis of
rotation of the fan blades is oscillating.

In some examples of rotation, however, the
axis may not be fixed. A prominent example of
this kind of rotation is a top spinning in place
[Fig. 6.5(a)]. (We assume that the top does not
slip from place to place and so does not have
translational motion.) We know from experience
that the axis of such a spinning top moves
around the vertical through its point of contact
with the ground, sweeping out a cone as shown
in Fig. 6.5(a). (This movement of the axis of the
top around the vertical is termed precession.)
Note, the point of contact of the top with
ground is fixed. The axis of rotation of the top
at any instant passes through the point of
contact. Another simple example of this kind of
rotation is the oscillating table fan or a pedestal
fan [Fig.6.5(b)]. You may have observed that the



SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

95

axis of rotation of such a fan has an oscillating
(sidewise) movement in a horizontal plane about
the vertical through the point at which the axis
is pivoted (point O in Fig. 6.5(b)).
While the fan rotates and its axis moves
sidewise, this point is fixed. Thus, in more
general cases of rotation, such as the rotation
of a top or a pedestal fan, one point and not
one line, of the rigid body is fixed. In this case
the axis is not fixed, though it always passes
through the fixed point. In our study, however,
we mostly deal with the simpler and special case
of rotation in which one line (i.e. the axis) is fixed.

Thus, for us rotation will be about a fixed axis
only unless stated otherwise.
The rolling motion of a cylinder down an
inclined plane is a combination of rotation about
a fixed axis and translation. Thus, the
‘something else’ in the case of rolling motion
which we referred to earlier is rotational motion.
You will find Fig. 6.6(a) and (b) instructive from
this point of view. Both these figures show
motion of the same body along identical
translational trajectory. In one case, Fig. 6.6(a),
the motion is a pure translation; in the other
case [Fig. 6.6(b)] it is a combination of translation
and rotation. (You may try to reproduce the two
types of motion shown, using a rigid object like
a heavy book.)
We now recapitulate the most important
observations of the present section: The motion
of a rigid body which is not pivoted or fixed in
some way is either a pure translation or a
combination of translation and rotation. The
motion of a rigid body which is pivoted or fixed
in some way is rotation. The rotation may be
about an axis that is fixed (e.g. a ceiling fan) or
moving (e.g. an oscillating table fan [Fig.6.5(b)]).
We shall, in the present chapter, consider
rotational motion about a fixed axis only.

Fig. 6.6(a)

Motion of a rigid body which is pure
translation.

6.2 CENTRE OF MASS

Fig. 6.6(b) Motion of a rigid body which is a
combination of translation and
rotation.
Fig 6.6 (a) and 6.6 (b) illustrate different motions of
the same body. Note P is an arbitrary point of the
body; O is the centre of mass of the body, which is
defined in the next section. Suffice to say here that
the trajectories of O are the translational trajectories
Tr1 and Tr2 of the body. The positions O and P at
three different instants of time are shown by O1, O2,
and O3, and P 1, P 2 and P3, respectively, in both
Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b) . As seen from Fig. 6.6(a), at any
instant the velocities of any particles like O and P of
the body are the same in pure translation. Notice, in
this case the orientation of OP, i.e. the angle OP makes
with a fixed direction, say the horizontal, remains
the same, i.e. α1 = α2 = α3. Fig. 6.6 (b) illustrates a case
of combination of translation and rotation. In this case,
at any instants the velocities of O and P differ. Also,
α1, α2 and α3 may all be different.

We shall first see what the centre of mass of a
system of particles is and then discuss its
significance. For simplicity we shall start with
a two particle system. We shall take the line
joining the two particles to be the x- axis.

Fig. 6.7

Let the distances of the two particles be x1
and x2 respectively from some origin O. Let m1
and m2 be respectively the masses of the two

particles. The centre of mass of the system is
that point C which is at a distance X from O,
where X is given by

X =

m 1 x1 + m 2 x 2
m1 + m 2

(6.1)

In Eq. (6.1), X can be regarded as the massweighted mean of x1 and x2. If the two particles
have the same mass m1 = m2 = m, then
mx 1 + mx 2 x 1 + x 2
=
2m
2
Thus, for two particles of equal mass the
centre of mass lies exactly midway between
them.
If we have n particles of masses m1, m2,
...mn respectively, along a straight line taken as
the x- axis, then by definition the position of the
centre of the mass of the system of particles is
given by.
X =

m (y1 + y 2 + y 3 ) y1 + y 2 + y 3
=
3m
3
Thus, for three particles of equal mass, the
centre of mass coincides with the centroid of the
triangle formed by the particles.
Results of Eqs. (6.3a) and (6.3b) are
generalised easily to a system of n particles, not
necessarily lying in a plane, but distributed in
space. The centre of mass of such a system is
at (X, Y, Z ), where

Suppose that we have three particles, not
lying in a straight line. We may define x– and y–
axes in the plane in which the particles lie and
represent the positions of the three particles by
coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3) respectively.
Let the masses of the three particles be m1, m2
and m3 respectively. The centre of mass C of

A rigid body, such as a metre stick or a
flywheel, is a system of closely packed particles;
Eqs. (6.4a), (6.4b), (6.4c) and (6.4d) are therefore,
applicable to a rigid body. The number of
particles (atoms or molecules) in such a body is
so large that it is impossible to carry out the
summations over individual particles in these
equations. Since the spacing of the particles is



SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

97

small, we can treat the body as a continuous
distribution of mass. We subdivide the body into
n small elements of mass; ∆m1, ∆m2... ∆mn; the
ith element ∆mi is taken to be located about the
point (xi, yi, zi). The coordinates of the centre of
mass are then approximately given by

Let us consider a thin rod, whose width and
breath (in case the cross section of the rod is
rectangular) or radius (in case the cross section
of the rod is cylindrical) is much smaller than
its length. Taking the origin to be at the
geometric centre of the rod and x-axis to be
along the length of the rod, we can say that on
account of reflection symmetry, for every
element dm of the rod at x, there is an element
of the same mass dm located at –x (Fig. 6.8).

X =

∑ (∆m i )x i , Y = ∑ (∆m i )yi , Z = ∑ (∆m i )zi
∑ ∆m i
∑ ∆m i
∑ ∆m i

As we make n bigger and bigger and each
∆m i smaller and smaller, these expressions
become exact. In that case, we denote the sums
over i by integrals. Thus,

∑ ∆m i → ∫ dm = M ,

∑ ( ∆m i )x i → ∫ x dm ,
∑ ( ∆m i )yi → ∫ y dm ,
and

∑ (∆m i )zi → ∫ z dm

Here M is the total mass of the body. The

i.e., ∫ r dm = 0

(6.6)

Often we have to calculate the centre of mass of
homogeneous bodies of regular shapes like rings,
discs, spheres, rods etc. (By a homogeneous body
we mean a body with uniformly distributed
mass.) By using symmetry consideration, we can
easily show that the centres of mass of these
bodies lie at their geometric centres.

The net contribution of every such pair to
itself
the integral and hence the integral
is zero. From Eq. (6.6), the point for which the
integral itself is zero, is the centre of mass.
Thus, the centre of mass of a homogenous thin
rod coincides with its geometric centre. This can
be understood on the basis of reflection symmetry.
The same symmetry argument will apply to
homogeneous rings, discs, spheres, or even
thick rods of circular or rectangular cross
section. For all such bodies you will realise that
for every element dm at a point (x, y, z ) one can
always take an element of the same mass at
the point (–x, –y, –z ). (In other words, the origin
is a point of reflection symmetry for these
bodies.) As a result, the integrals in Eq. (6.5 a)
all are zero. This means that for all the above
bodies, their centre of mass coincides with their
geometric centre.

Answer Choosing the X and Y axes as shown
in Fig. 6.11 we have the coordinates of the
vertices of the L-shaped lamina as given in the
figure.
We
can
think
of
the
L-shape to consist of 3 squares each of length
1m. The mass of each square is 1kg, since the
lamina is uniform. The centres of mass C1, C2
and C3 of the squares are, by symmetry, their
geometric centres and have coordinates (1/2,1/2),
(3/2,1/2), (1/2,3/2) respectively. We take the
masses of the squares to be concentrated at
these points. The centre of mass of the whole
L shape (X, Y) is the centre of mass of these
mass points.

The centre of mass C is shown in the figure.
Note that it is not the geometric centre of the
triangle OAB. Why?

Answer The lamina (∆LMN ) may be subdivided
into narrow strips each parallel to the base (MN)
as shown in Fig. 6.10

Hence
X =

Fig. 6.10

By symmetry each strip has its centre of
mass at its midpoint. If we join the midpoint of
all the strips we get the median LP. The centre
of mass of the triangle as a whole therefore, has
to lie on the median LP. Similarly, we can argue
that it lies on the median MQ and NR. This
means the centre of mass lies on the point of

The centre of mass of the L-shape lies on

SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

99

of Fig. 6.11 had different masses. How will you
then determine the centre of mass of the lamina?
⊳

Thus, the total mass of a system of particles
times the acceleration of its centre of mass is
the vector sum of all the forces acting on the
system of particles.

6.3 MOTION OF CENTRE OF MASS

Note when we talk of the force F1 on the first
particle, it is not a single force, but the vector
sum of all the forces on the first particle; likewise
for the second particle etc. Among these forces
on each particle there will be external forces
exerted by bodies outside the system and also
internal forces exerted by the particles on one
another. We know from Newton’s third law that
these internal forces occur in equal and opposite
pairs and in the sum of forces of Eq. (6.10), their
contribution is zero. Only the external forces
contribute to the equation. We can then rewrite
Eq. (6.10) as

Equipped with the definition of the centre of
mass, we are now in a position to discuss its
physical importance for a system of n particles.
We may rewrite Eq.(6.4d) as

MR = ∑ m i ri = m1r1 + m 2 r2 + ... + m n rn

(6.7)

Differentiating the two sides of the equation
with respect to time we get

M

dR
= m1 1 + m 2 2 + ... + m n n
dt
dt
dt
dt

or

M V = m1 v1 + m 2 v 2 + ... + m n vn

(6.8)

where v1 ( = dr1 /dt ) is the velocity of the first
particle v 2 ( = dr 2 dt ) is the velocity of the
second particle etc. and V = dR / dt is the
velocity of the centre of mass. Note that we
assumed the masses m 1, m 2, ... etc. do not
change in time. We have therefore, treated them
as constants in differentiating the equations
with respect to time.
Differentiating Eq.(6.8) with respect to time,
we obtain

M

dv1
dv 2
dv n
dV
= m1
+ m2
+ ... + m n
dt
dt

dt

or
MA = m 1a1 + m 2 a 2 + ... + m n an

(6.9)

where a1 ( = dv1 /dt ) is the acceleration of the
first particle, a 2 ( = dv2 /dt ) is the acceleration
of the second particle etc. and A (= d V / dt ) is
the acceleration of the centre of mass of the
system of particles.
Now, from Newton’s second law, the force
acting on the first particle is given by F1 = m1a1 .
The force acting on the second particle is given
by F2 = m 2 a 2 and so on. Eq. (6.9) may be written
as

MA = F1 + F2 + ... + Fn

(6.10)

MA = Fext

(6.11)

where Fext represents the sum of all external
forces acting on the particles of the system.
Eq. (6.11) states that the centre of mass of
a system of particles moves as if all the mass
of the system was concentrated at the centre
of mass and all the external forces were
applied at that point.
Notice, to determine the motion of the centre
of mass no knowledge of internal forces of the
system of particles is required; for this purpose
we need to know only the external forces.
To obtain Eq. (6.11) we did not need to specify
the nature of the system of particles. The system
may be a collection of particles in which there
may be all kinds of internal motions, or it may
be a rigid body which has either pure
translational motion or a combination of
translational and rotational motion. Whatever
is the system and the motion of its individual
particles, the centre of mass moves according
to Eq. (6.11).
Instead of treating extended bodies as single
particles as we have done in earlier chapters,
we can now treat them as systems of particles.
We can obtain the translational component of
their motion, i.e. the motion of the centre of mass
of the system, by taking the mass of the whole
system to be concentrated at the centre of mass
and all the external forces on the system to be
acting at the centre of mass.
This is the procedure that we followed earlier
in analysing forces on bodies and solving



100

PHYSICS

problems without explicitly outlining and
justifying the procedure. We now realise that in
earlier studies we assumed, without saying so,
that rotational motion and/or internal motion
of the particles were either absent or negligible.
We no longer need to do this. We have not only
found the justification of the procedure we
followed earlier; but we also have found how to
describe and separate the translational motion
of (1) a rigid body which may be rotating as
well, or (2) a system of particles with all kinds
of internal motion.

where F is the force on the particle. Let us
consider a system of n particles with masses m1,
m2,...mn respectively and velocities v1 , v 2 ,.......vn
respectively. The particles may be interacting
and have external forces acting on them. The
linear momentum of the first particle is m1v1 ,
of the second particle is m 2 v 2 and so on.
For the system of n particles, the linear
momentum of the system is defined to be the
vector sum of all individual particles of the
system,

P = p1 + p2 + ... + pn
= m1 v1 + m 2 v 2 + ... + m n vn
(6.14)
Comparing this with Eq. (6.8)
P=MV
(6.15)
Thus, the total momentum of a system of
particles is equal to the product of the total
mass of the system and the velocity of its
centre of mass. Differentiating Eq. (6.15) with
respect to time,
Fig. 6.12

The centre of mass of the fragments
of the projectile continues along the
same parabolic path which it would
have followed if there were no
explosion.

Figure 6.12 is a good illustration of Eq. (6.11).
A projectile, following the usual parabolic
trajectory, explodes into fragments midway in
air. The forces leading to the explosion are
internal forces. They contribute nothing to the
motion of the centre of mass. The total external
force, namely, the force of gravity acting on the
body, is the same before and after the explosion.
The centre of mass under the influence of the
external force continues, therefore, along the
same parabolic trajectory as it would have
followed if there were no explosion.
6.4 LINEAR MOMENTUM OF A SYSTEM OF
PARTICLES
Let us recall that the linear momentum of a
particle is defined as
p=mv
(6.12)
Let us also recall that Newton’s second law
written in symbolic form for a single particle is

F=

Comparing Eq.(6.16) and Eq. (6.11),
dP
= Fext
(6.17)
dt
This is the statement of Newton’s second law
of motion extended to a system of particles.
Suppose now, that the sum of external
forces acting on a system of particles is zero.
Then from Eq.(6.17)
dP
= 0 or P = Constant
(6.18a)
dt
Thus, when the total external force acting
on a system of particles is zero, the total linear
momentum of the system is constant. This is
the law of conservation of the total linear
momentum of a system of particles. Because of
Eq. (6.15), this also means that when the
total external force on the system is zero
the velocity of the centre of mass remains
constant. (We assume throughout the
discussion on systems of particles in this
chapter that the total mass of the system
remains constant.)
Note that on account of the internal forces,
i.e. the forces exerted by the particles on one
another, the individual particles may have



SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

complicated trajectories. Yet, if the total external
force acting on the system is zero, the centre of
mass moves with a constant velocity, i.e., moves
uniformly in a straight line like a free particle.
The vector Eq. (6.18a) is equivalent to three
scalar equations,
Px = c1, Py = c2 and Pz = c3
(6.18 b)
Here Px, Py and Pz are the components of the
total linear momentum vector P along the x–, y–
and z–axes respectively; c 1 , c 2 and c 3 are
constants.

particle (nucleus of helium atom). The CM
of the system is in uniform motion.
(b) The same spliting of the heavy nucleus
radium (Ra) with the centre of mass at
rest. The two product particles fly back
to back.

As an example, let us consider the
radioactive decay of a moving unstable particle,
like the nucleus of radium. A radium nucleus
disintegrates into a nucleus of radon and an
alpha particle. The forces leading to the decay
are internal to the system and the external
forces on the system are negligible. So the total
linear momentum of the system is the same
before and after decay. The two particles
produced in the decay, the radon nucleus and
the alpha particle, move in different directions
in such a way that their centre of mass moves
along the same path along which the original
decaying radium nucleus was moving
[Fig. 6.13(a)].
If we observe the decay from the frame of
reference in which the centre of mass is at rest,
the motion of the particles involved in the decay
looks particularly simple; the product particles

move back to back with their centre of mass
remaining at rest as shown in Fig.6.13 (b).
In many problems on the system of
particles, as in the above radioactive decay
problem, it is convenient to work in the centre
of mass frame rather than in the laboratory
frame of reference.
In astronomy, binary (double) stars is a
common occurrence. If there are no external
forces, the centre of mass of a double star
moves like a free particle, as shown in Fig.6.14
(a). The trajectories of the two stars of equal
mass are also shown in the figure; they look
complicated. If we go to the centre of mass
frame, then we find that there the two stars
are moving in a circle, about the centre of
mass, which is at rest. Note that the position
of the stars have to be diametrically opposite
to each other [Fig. 6.14(b)]. Thus in our frame
of reference, the trajectories of the stars are a
combination of (i) uniform motion in a straight
line of the centre of mass and (ii) circular
orbits of the stars about the centre of mass.
As can be seen from the two examples,
separating the motion of different parts of a
system into motion of the centre of mass and
motion about the centre of mass is a very
useful technique that helps in understanding
the motion of the system.
6.5 VECTOR PRODUCT OF TWO VECTORS
We are already familiar with vectors and their
use in physics. In chapter 5 (Work, Energy, Power)
we defined the scalar product of two vectors. An
important physical quantity, work, is defined as
a scalar product of two vector quantities, force
and displacement.



102

PHYSICS

We shall now define another product of two
vectors. This product is a vector. Two important
quantities in the study of rotational motion,
namely, moment of a force and angular
momentum, are defined as vector products.
Definition of Vector Product
A vector product of two vectors a and b is a
vector c such that
(i) magnitude of c = c = ab sin θ where a and b
are magnitudes of a and b and θ is the
angle between the two vectors.
(ii) c is perpendicular to the plane containing
a and b.
(iii) if we take a right handed screw with its head
lying in the plane of a and b and the screw
perpendicular to this plane, and if we turn
the head in the direction from a to b, then
the tip of the screw advances in the direction
of c. This right handed screw rule is
illustrated in Fig. 6.15a.
Alternately, if one curls up the fingers of
right hand around a line perpendicular to the
plane of the vectors a and b and if the fingers
are curled up in the direction from a to b, then
the stretched thumb points in the direction of
c, as shown in Fig. 6.15b.

A simpler version of the right hand rule is
the following : Open up your right hand palm
and curl the fingers pointing from a to b. Your
stretched thumb points in the direction of c.
It should be remembered that there are two
angles between any two vectors a and b . In
Fig. 6.15 (a) or (b) they correspond to θ (as shown)
and (3600– θ). While applying either of the above
rules, the rotation should be taken through the
smaller angle (<1800) between a and b. It is θ
here.
Because of the cross (×) used to denote the
vector product, it is also referred to as cross product.
• Note that scalar product of two vectors is
commutative as said earlier, a.b = b.a
The vector product, however, is not
commutative, i.e. a × b ≠ b × a
The magnitude of both a × b and b × a is the
same ( ab sin θ ); also, both of them ar e
perpendicular to the plane of a and b. But the
rotation of the right-handed screw in case of
a × b is from a to b, whereas in case of b × a it
is from b to a. This means the two vectors are
in opposite directions. We have

•

a × b = −b × a
Another interesting property of a vector
product is its behaviour under reflection.
Under reflection (i.e. on taking the plane
mirror
image)
we
have

x → − x , y → −y and z → − z . As a result all
the components of a vector change sign and
thus a → −a , b → −b . What happens to
a × b under reflection?
a × b → ( −a ) × ( − b) = a × b
Thus, a × b does not change sign under
reflection.
• Both scalar and vector products are
distributive with respect to vector addition.
Thus,

a.( b + c) = a.b + a.c

defining the direction of the vector
product of two vectors.
(b) Rule of the right hand for defining the
direction of the vector product.

a × ( b + c) = a × b + a × c

We may write c = a × b in the component
form. For this we first need to obtain some
elementary cross products:
(i) a × a = 0 (0 is a null vector, i.e. a vector
with zero magnitude)
This follows since magnitude of a × a is

a 2 sin 0° = 0 .

6.6 ANGULAR VELOCITY AND ITS RELATION
WITH LINEAR VELOCITY
In this section we shall study what is angular
velocity and its role in rotational motion. We
have seen that every particle of a rotating body
moves in a circle. The linear velocity of the
particle is related to the angular velocity. The
relation between these two quantities involves
a vector product which we learnt about in the
last section.
Let us go back to Fig. 6.4. As said above, in
rotational motion of a rigid body about a fixed
axis, every particle of the body moves in a circle,

which lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis
and has its centre on the axis. In Fig. 6.16 we
redraw Fig. 6.4, showing a typical particle (at a
point P) of the rigid body rotating about a fixed
axis (taken as the z-axis). The particle describes



104

PHYSICS

a circle with a centre C on the axis. The radius
of the circle is r, the perpendicular distance of
the point P from the axis. We also show the
linear velocity vector v of the particle at P. It is
along the tangent at P to the circle.
Let P′ be the position of the particle after an
interval of time ∆t (Fig. 6.16). The angle PCP′
describes the angular displacement ∆θ of the
particle in time ∆t. The average angular velocity
of the particle over the interval ∆t is ∆θ/∆t. As
∆t tends to zero (i.e. takes smaller and smaller
values), the ratio ∆θ/∆t approaches a limit which
is the instantaneous angular velocity dθ/dt of
the particle at the position P. We denote the
instantaneous angular velocity by ω (the
Greek letter omega). We know from our study
of circular motion that the magnitude of linear
velocity v of a particle moving in a circle is
related to the angular velocity of the particle ω
by the simple relation υ = ω r , where r is the
radius of the circle.
We observe that at any given instant the
relation v = ω r applies to all particles of the
rigid body. Thus for a particle at a perpendicular
distance ri from the fixed axis, the linear velocity
at a given instant vi is given by

vi = ω ri
(6.19)
The index i runs from 1 to n, where n is the
total number of particles of the body.
For particles on the axis, r = 0 , and hence
v = ω r = 0. Thus, particles on the axis are
stationary. This verifies that the axis is fixed.
Note that we use the same angular velocity
ω for all the particles. We therefore, refer to ω
as the angular velocity of the whole body.
We have characterised pure translation of
a body by all parts of the body having the same
velocity at any instant of time. Similarly, we
may characterise pure rotation by all parts of
the body having the same angular velocity at
any instant of time. Note that this
characterisation of the rotation of a rigid body
about a fixed axis is just another way of saying
as in Sec. 6.1 that each particle of the body moves
in a circle, which lies in a plane perpendicular
to the axis and has the centre on the axis.
In our discussion so far the angular velocity
appears to be a scalar. In fact, it is a vector. We
shall not justify this fact, but we shall accept
it. For rotation about a fixed axis, the angular
velocity vector lies along the axis of rotation,

and points out in the direction in which a right
handed screw would advance, if the head of the
screw is rotated with the body. (See Fig. 6.17a).
The magnitude of this vector is ω = dθ dt
referred as above.

Fig. 6.17 (a) If the head of a right handed screw
rotates with the body, the screw
advances in the direction of the angular
velocity ω. If the sense (clockwise or
anticlockwise) of rotation of the body
changes, so does the direction of ω.

Fig. 6.17 (b) The angular velocity vector ω is directed
along the fixed axis as shown. The linear
velocity of the particle at P is v = ω × r.
It is perpendicular to both ω and r and
is directed along the tangent to the circle
described by the particle.

We shall now look at what the vector
product ω × r corresponds to. Refer to Fig.
6.17(b) which is a part of Fig. 6.16 reproduced
to show the path of the particle P. The figure
shows the vector ω directed along the fixed (z–)
axis and also the position vector r = OP of the
particle at P of the rigid body with respect to
the origin O. Note that the origin is chosen to
be on the axis of rotation.



SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

105

ω × r = ω × OP = ω × (OC + CP)
ω × OC = 0 as ω is along OC
ω × r = ω × CP

If the axis of rotation is fixed, the direction
of ω and hence, that of α is fixed. In this case
the vector equation reduces to a scalar equation

Now
But
Hence

The vector ω × CP is perpendicular to ω, i.e.
to the z-axis and also to CP, the radius of the
circle described by the particle at P. It is
therefore, along the tangent to the circle at P.
Also, the magnitude of ω × CP is ω (CP) since
ω and CP are perpendicular to each other. We
shall denote CP by r⊥ and not by r, as we did
earlier.
Thus, ω × r is a vector of magnitude ω r⊥
and is along the tangent to the circle described
by the particle at P. The linear velocity vector v
at P has the same magnitude and direction.
Thus,
(6.20)
v =ω × r
In fact, the relation, Eq. (6.20), holds good
even for rotation of a rigid body with one point
fixed, such as the rotation of the top [Fig. 6.6(a)].
In this case r represents the position vector of
the particle with respect to the fixed point taken
as the origin.
We note that for rotation about a fixed
axis, the direction of the vector ω does not
change with time. Its magnitude may,
however, change from instant to instant. For
the more general rotation, both the
magnitude and the direction of ω may change
from instant to instant.
6.6.1 Angular acceleration
You may have noticed that we are developing
the study of rotational motion along the lines
of the study of translational motion with which
we are already familiar. Analogous to the kinetic
variables of linear displacement (s) and velocity
(v) in translational motion, we have angular
θ ) and angular velocity (ω
ω) in
displacement (θ
rotational motion. It is then natural to define
in rotational motion the concept of angular
acceleration in analogy with linear acceleration
defined as the time rate of change of velocity in
translational motion. We define angular
acceleration α as the time rate of change of
angular velocity. Thus,
α=

6.7 TORQUE AND ANGULAR MOMENTUM
In this section, we shall acquaint ourselves with
two physical quantities (torque and angular
momentum) which are defined as vector products
of two vectors. These as we shall see, are
especially important in the discussion of motion
of systems of particles, particularly rigid bodies.
6.7.1 Moment of force (Torque)
We have learnt that the motion of a rigid body,
in general, is a combination of rotation and
translation. If the body is fixed at a point or along
a line, it has only rotational motion. We know
that force is needed to change the translational
state of a body, i.e. to produce linear
acceleration. We may then ask, what is the
analogue of force in the case of rotational
motion? To look into the question in a concrete
situation let us take the example of opening or
closing of a door. A door is a rigid body which
can rotate about a fixed vertical axis passing
through the hinges. What makes the door
rotate? It is clear that unless a force is applied
the door does not rotate. But any force does not
do the job. A force applied to the hinge line
cannot produce any rotation at all, whereas a
force of given magnitude applied at right angles
to the door at its outer edge is most effective in
producing rotation. It is not the force alone, but
how and where the force is applied is important
in rotational motion.
The rotational analogue of force in linear
motion is moment of force. It is also referred to
as torque or couple. (We shall use the words
moment of force and torque interchangeably.)
We shall first define the moment of force for the
special case of a single particle. Later on we
shall extend the concept to systems of particles
including rigid bodies. We shall also relate it to
a change in the state of rotational motion, i.e. is
angular acceleration of a rigid body.

of the line of action of F from the origin and
F⊥ ( = F sin θ ) is the component of F in the
direction perpendicular to r. Note that τ = 0 if
r = 0, F = 0 or θ = 00 or 1800 . Thus, the moment
of a force vanishes if either the magnitude of
the force is zero, or if the line of action of the
force passes through the origin.
One may note that since r × F is a vector
product, properties of a vector product of two
vectors apply to it. If the direction of F is
reversed, the direction of the moment of force
is reversed. If directions of both r and F are
reversed, the direction of the moment of force
remains the same.
6.7.2 Angular momentum of a particle

Fig. 6.18

τ = r × F, τ is perpendicular to the plane
containing r and F, and its direction is
given by the right handed screw rule.

If a force acts on a single particle at a point
P whose position with respect to the origin O is
given by the position vector r (Fig. 6.18), the
moment of the force acting on the particle with
respect to the origin O is defined as the vector
product
τ=r×F
(6.23)
The moment of force (or torque) is a vector
quantity. The symbol τ stands for the Greek
letter tau. The magnitude of τ is
τ = r F sinθ
(6.24a)
where r is the magnitude of the position vector
r, i.e. the length OP, F is the magnitude of force
F and θ is the angle between r and F as
shown.
Moment of force has dimensions M L2 T -2.
Its dimensions are the same as those of work
or energy. It is, however, a very different physical
quantity than work. Moment of a force is a
vector, while work is a scalar. The SI unit of
moment of force is newton metre (N m). The
magnitude of the moment of force may be
written

τ = (r sin θ )F = r⊥ F

(6.24b)

or τ = r F sin θ = rF⊥

(6.24c)

where r⊥ = r sinθ is the perpendicular distance

Just as the moment of a force is the rotational
analogue of force in linear motion, the quantity
angular momentum is the rotational analogue
of linear momentum. We shall first define
angular momentum for the special case of a
single particle and look at its usefulness in the
context of single particle motion. We shall then
extend the definition of angular momentum to
systems of particles including rigid bodies.
Like moment of a force, angular momentum
is also a vector product. It could also be referred
to as moment of (linear) momentum. From this
term one could guess how angular momentum
is defined.
Consider a particle of mass m and linear
momentum p at a position r relative to the origin
O. The angular momentum l of the particle with
respect to the origin O is defined to be
l=r×p
(6.25a)
The magnitude of the angular momentum
vector is

l = r p sin θ

(6.26a)
where p is the magnitude of p and θ is the angle
between r and p. We may write

l = r p ⊥ or r⊥ p

(6.26b)

where r⊥ (= r sinθ) is the perpendicular distance
of the directional line of p from the origin and

p ⊥ ( = p sin θ ) is the component of p in a direction
perpendicular to r. We expect the angular
momentum to be zero (l = 0), if the linear
momentum vanishes (p = 0), if the particle is at
the origin (r = 0), or if the directional line of p
passes through the origin θ = 00 or 1800.



SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

The physical quantities, moment of a force
and angular momentum, have an important
relation between them. It is the rotational
analogue of the relation between force and linear
momentum. For deriving the relation in the
context of a single particle, we differentiate
l = r × p with respect to time,

dl

( r × p)

Applying the product rule for differentiation
to the right hand side,

Now, the velocity of the particle is v = dr/dt
and p = m v

vanishes. Further, since dp / dt = F,
Because of this

Hence
or

d
( r × p) = τ

(6.27)

Thus, the time rate of change of the angular
momentum of a particle is equal to the torque
acting on it. This is the rotational analogue of
the equation F = dp/dt, which expresses
Newton’s second law for the translational motion
of a single particle.
Torque and angular momentum for a system
of particles
To get the total angular momentum of a system
of particles about a given point we need to add
vectorially the angular momenta of individual
particles. Thus, for a system of n particles,

The angular momentum of the ith particle
is given by
li = ri × pi
where ri is the position vector of the ith particle
with respect to a given origin and p = (mivi) is
the linear momentum of the particle. (The

The rotating rim gives rise to an angular

of the torque on the angular momentum is to

τ = τext + τ int ,

We shall assume not only Newton’s third law
of motion, i.e. the forces between any two particles
of the system are equal and opposite, but also that
these forces are directed along the line joining the
two particles. In this case the contribution of the
internal forces to the total torque on the system is
zero, since the torque resulting from each actionreaction pair of forces is zero. We thus have, τint =
0 and therefore τ = τext.

Note that like Eq.(6.17), Eq.(6.28b) holds
good for any system of particles, whether it is a
rigid body or its individual particles have all
kinds of internal motion.
Conservation of angular momentum
If τext = 0, Eq. (6.28b) reduces to

dL

or
L = constant.
(6.29a)
Thus, if the total external torque on a system
of particles is zero, then the total angular
momentum of the system is conserved, i.e.
remains constant. Eq. (6.29a) is equivalent to
three scalar equations,
Lx = K1, Ly = K2 and Lz = K3
(6.29 b)
Here K1, K2 and K3 are constants; Lx, Ly and
Lz are the components of the total angular
momentum vector L along the x,y and z axes
respectively. The statement that the total
angular momentum is conserved means that
each of these three components is conserved.
Eq. (6.29a) is the rotational analogue of
Eq. (6.18a), i.e. the conservation law of the total
linear momentum for a system of particles.
Like Eq. (6.18a), it has applications in many
practical situations. We shall look at a few of
the interesting applications later on in
this chapter.

acting on the system taken about the same

the particle changes position with time, the line
of direction of v remains the same and hence
OM = r sin θ. is a constant.
Further, the direction of l is perpendicular
to the plane of r and v. It is into the page of the
figure.This direction does not change with time.
Thus, l remains the same in magnitude and
direction and is therefore conserved. Is there
any external torque on the particle?

6.8 EQUILIBRIUM OF A RIGID BODY
We are now going to concentrate on the motion
of rigid bodies rather than on the motion of
general systems of particles.
We shall recapitulate what effect the
external forces have on a rigid body. (Henceforth
we shall omit the adjective ‘external’ because
unless stated otherwise, we shall deal with only
external forces and torques.) The forces change
the translational state of the motion of the rigid
body, i.e. they change its total linear
momentum in accordance with Eq. (6.17). But
this is not the only effect the forces have. The
total torque on the body may not vanish. Such
a torque changes the rotational state of motion
of the rigid body, i.e. it changes the total angular
momentum of the body in accordance with
Eq. (6.28 b).
A rigid body is said to be in mechanical
equilibrium, if both its linear momentum and
angular momentum are not changing with time,
or equivalently, the body has neither linear

If the total torque on the rigid body is zero,
the total angular momentum of the body does
not change with time. Eq. (6.30 b) gives the
condition for the rotational equilibrium of the
body.
One may raise a question, whether the
rotational equilibrium condition [Eq. 6.30(b)]
remains valid, if the origin with respect to which
the torques are taken is shifted. One can show
that if the translational equilibrium condition
[Eq. 6.30(a)] holds for a rigid body, then such a
shift of origin does not matter, i.e. the rotational
equilibrium condition is independent of the
location of the origin about which the torques
are taken. Example 6.7 gives a proof of this result
in a special case of a couple, i.e. two forces
acting on a rigid body in translational
equilibrium. The generalisation of this result to
n forces is left as an exercise.
Eq. (6.30a) and Eq. (6.30b), both, are vector
equations. They are equivalent to three scalar
equations each. Eq. (6.30a) corresponds to

equilibrium of a rigid body. In a number of
problems all the forces acting on the body are
coplanar. Then we need only three conditions
to be satisfied for mechanical equilibrium. Two
of these conditions correspond to translational
equilibrium; the sum of the components of the
forces along any two perpendicular axes in the
plane must be zero. The third condition
corresponds to rotational equilibrium. The sum
of the components of the torques along any axis
perpendicular to the plane of the forces must
be zero.
The conditions of equilibrium of a rigid body
may be compared with those for a particle, which
we considered in earlier chapters. Since
consideration of rotational motion does not apply
to a particle, only the conditions for translational
equilibrium (Eq. 6.30 a) apply to a particle. Thus,
for equilibrium of a particle the vector sum of
all the forces on it must be zero. Since all these
forces act on the single particle, they must be
concurrent. Equilibrium under concurrent
forces was discussed in the earlier chapters.
A body may be in partial equilibrium, i.e., it
may be in translational equilibrium and not in
rotational equilibrium, or it may be in rotational
equilibrium and not in translational
equilibrium.
Consider a light (i.e. of negligible mass) rod
(AB) as shown in Fig. 6.20(a). At the two ends (A
and B) of which two parallel forces, both equal
in magnitude and acting along same direction
are applied perpendicular to the rod.

Fig. 6.20 (b)

The force at B in Fig. 6.20(a) is reversed in
Fig. 6.20(b). Thus, we have the same rod with
two forces of equal magnitude but acting in
opposite diretions applied perpendicular to the
rod, one at end A and the other at end B. Here
the moments of both the forces are equal, but
they are not opposite; they act in the same sense
and cause anticlockwise rotation of the rod. The
total force on the body is zero; so the body is in
translational equilibrium; but it is not in
rotational equilibrium. Although the rod is not
fixed in any way, it undergoes pure rotation (i.e.
rotation without translation).
A pair of forces of equal magnitude but acting
in opposite directions with different lines of
action is known as a couple or torque. A couple
produces rotation without translation.
When we open the lid of a bottle by turning
it, our fingers are applying a couple to the lid
[Fig. 6.21(a)]. Another known example is a
compass needle in the earth’s magnetic field as
shown in the Fig. 6.21(b). The earth’s magnetic
field exerts equal forces on the north and south
poles. The force on the North Pole is towards
the north, and the force on the South Pole is
toward the south. Except when the needle points
in the north-south direction; the two forces do
not have the same line of action. Thus there is
a couple acting on the needle due to the earth’s
magnetic field.

Fig. 6.20 (a)

Let C be the midpoint of AB, CA = CB = a.
the moment of the forces at A and B will both
be equal in magnitude (aF ), but opposite in
sense as shown. The net moment on the rod will
be zero. The system will be in rotational
equilibrium, but it will not be in translational
equilibrium; ∑ F ≠ 0

length. This point is called the fulcrum. A seesaw on the children’s playground is a typical
example of a lever. Two forces F1 and F2, parallel
to each other and usually perpendicular to the
lever, as shown here, act on the lever at
distances d1 and d2 respectively from the fulcrum
as shown in Fig. 6.23.

equilibrium. Let R be the reaction of the support

forces F1 and F2. For translational equilibrium,

Answer

Fig. 6.22

Consider a couple as shown in Fig. 6.22
acting on a rigid body. The forces F and -F act
respectively at points B and A. These points have
position vectors r1 and r2 with respect to origin
O. Let us take the moments of the forces about
the origin.
The moment of the couple = sum of the
moments of the two forces making the couple
= r1 × (–F) + r2 × F
= r2 × F – r1 × F
= (r2–r1) × F
But r1 + AB = r2, and hence AB = r2 – r1.
The moment of the couple, therefore, is
AB × F.
Clearly this is independent of the origin, the
point about which we took the moments of the
forces.
⊳
6.8.1 Principle of moments
An ideal lever is essentially a light (i.e. of
negligible mass) rod pivoted at a point along its

(i)

For considering rotational equilibrium we
take the moments about the fulcrum; the sum
of moments must be zero,
d1F1 – d2F2 = 0
(ii)
Normally the anticlockwise (clockwise)
moments are taken to be positive (negative). Note
R acts at the fulcrum itself and has zero moment
about the fulcrum.
In the case of the lever force F1 is usually
some weight to be lifted. It is called the load and
its distance from the fulcrum d1 is called the
load arm. Force F2 is the effort applied to lift the
load; distance d2 of the effort from the fulcrum
is the effort arm.
Eq. (ii) can be written as
d1F1 = d2 F2
(6.32a)
or load arm × load = effort arm × effort
The above equation expresses the principle
of moments for a lever. Incidentally the ratio
F1/F2 is called the Mechanical Advantage (M.A.);

F1 d 2
M.A. = F = d
2

(6.32b)

If the effort arm d2 is larger than the load
arm, the mechanical advantage is greater than
one. Mechanical advantage greater than one
means that a small effort can be used to lift a
large load. There are several examples of a lever
around you besides the see-saw. The beam of a
balance is a lever. Try to find more such

examples and identify the fulcrum, the effort and
effort arm, and the load and the load arm of the
lever in each case.
You may easily show that the principle of
moment holds even when the parallel forces F1
and F2 are not perpendicular, but act at some
angle, to the lever.

The CG of the cardboard is so located that
the total torque on it due to the forces m1g, m2g

If ri is the position vector of the ith particle
of an extended body with respect to its CG, then
the torque about the CG, due to the force of
gravity on the particle is τi = ri × mi g. The total
gravitational torque about the CG is zero, i.e.

6.8.2 Centre of gravity
Many of you may have the experience of
balancing your notebook on the tip of a finger.
Figure 6.24 illustrates a similar experiment that
you can easily perform. Take an irregularshaped cardboard having mass M and a narrow
tipped object like a pencil. You can locate by trial
and error a point G on the cardboard where it
can be balanced on the tip of the pencil. (The
cardboard remains horizontal in this position.)
This point of balance is the centre of gravity (CG)
of the cardboard. The tip of the pencil provides
a vertically upward force due to which the
cardboard is in mechanical equilibrium. As
shown in the Fig. 6.24, the reaction of the tip is
equal and opposite to Mg and hence the
cardboard is in translational equilibrium. It is
also in rotational equilibrium; if it were not so,
due to the unbalanced torque it would tilt and
fall. There are torques on the card board due to
the forces of gravity like m1g, m2g …. etc, acting
on the individual particles that make up the
cardboard.

Fig. 6.24

Balancing a cardboard on the tip of a
pencil. The point of support, G, is the
centre of gravity.

τ g = ∑ τ i = ∑ ri × m i g = 0

(6.33)

We may therefore, define the CG of a body
as that point where the total gravitational torque
on the body is zero.
We notice that in Eq. (6.33), g is the same
for all particles, and hence it comes out of the
summation. This gives, since g is non-zero,

∑ m r = 0. Remember that the position vectors
i i

(ri) are taken with respect to the CG. Now, in
accordance with the reasoning given below
Eq. (6.4a) in Sec. 6.2, if the sum is zero, the origin
must be the centre of mass of the body. Thus,
the centre of gravity of the body coincides with
the centre of mass in uniform gravity or gravity-

of suspension of the body A.

free space. We note that this is true because
the body being small,
g does not
vary from one point of the body to the other. If
the body is so extended that g varies from part
to part of the body, then the centre of gravity
and centre of mass will not coincide. Basically,
the two are different concepts. The centre of
mass has nothing to do with gravity. It depends
only on the distribution of mass of the body.
In Sec. 6.2 we found out the position of the
centre of mass of several regular, homogeneous
objects. Obviously the method used there gives
us also the centre of gravity of these bodies, if
they are small enough.
Figure 6.25 illustrates another way of
determining the CG of an irregular shaped body
like a cardboard. If you suspend the body from
some point like A, the vertical line through A
passes through the CG. We mark the vertical
AA1. We then suspend the body through other
points like B and C. The intersection of the
verticals gives the CG. Explain why the method
works. Since the body is small enough, the
method allows us to determine also its centre
of mass.

For translational equilibrium of the rod,
R1+R2 –W1 –W = 0
(i)
Note W1 and W act vertically down and R1
and R2 act vertically up.
For considering rotational equilibrium, we
take moments of the forces. A convenient point
to take moments about is G. The moments of
R2 and W1 are anticlockwise (+ve), whereas the
moment of R1 is clockwise (-ve).
For rotational equilibrium,
–R1 (K1G) + W1 (PG) + R2 (K2G) = 0
(ii)
It is given that W = 4.00g N and W1 = 6.00g
N, where g = acceleration due to gravity. We
take g = 9.8 m/s2.
With numerical values inserted, from (i)
R1 + R2 – 4.00g – 6.00g = 0
or R1 + R2 = 10.00g N

= 98.00 N
From (ii), – 0.25 R1 + 0.05 W1 + 0.25 R2 = 0
or R1 – R2 = 1.2g N = 11.76 N

From (iii) and (iv), R1 = 54.88 N,
R2 = 43.12 N
Thus the reactions of the support are about

The ladder AB is 3 m long, its foot A is at
distance AC = 1 m from the wall. From
Pythagoras theorem, BC = 2 2 m. The forces
on the ladder are its weight W acting at its centre
of gravity D, reaction forces F1 and F2 of the wall
and the floor respectively. Force F 1 is
perpendicular to the wall, since the wall is
frictionless. Force F 2 is resolved into two
components, the normal reaction N and the
force of friction F. Note that F prevents the ladder
from sliding away from the wall and is therefore
directed toward the wall.

6.9 MOMENT OF INERTIA
We have already mentioned that we are
developing the study of rotational motion parallel
to the study of translational motion with which
we are familiar. We have yet to answer one major
question in this connection. What is the
analogue of mass in rotational motion? We shall
attempt to answer this question in the present
section. To keep the discussion simple, we shall
consider rotation about a fixed axis only. Let us
try to get an expression for the kinetic energy of
a rotating body. We know that for a body rotating
about a fixed axis, each particle of the body moves
in a circle with linear velocity given by Eq. (6.19).
(Refer to Fig. 6.16). For a particle at a distance

m υ2
2
Here, m is the mass of the body and v is its
velocity. We have already noted the analogy
between angular velocity ω (in respect of
rotational motion about a fixed axis) and linear
velocity v (in respect of linear motion). It is then
evident that the parameter, moment of inertia
I, is the desired rotational analogue of mass in
linear motion. In rotation (about a fixed axis),
the moment of inertia plays a similar role as
mass does in linear motion.
We now apply the definition Eq. (6.34), to
calculate the moment of inertia in two simple cases.

(a) Consider a thin ring of radius R and mass
M, rotating in its own plane around its centre
with angular velocity ω. Each mass element
of the ring is at a distance R from the axis,
and moves with a speed Rω. The kinetic
energy is therefore,

change in its rotational motion, it can be
regarded as a measure of rotational inertia of
the body; it is a measure of the way in which
different parts of the body are distributed at
different distances from the axis. Unlike the
mass of a body, the moment of inertia is not a
fixed quantity but depends on distribution of
mass about the axis of rotation, and the
orientation and position of the axis of rotation
with respect to the body as a whole. As a
measure of the way in which the mass of a
rotating rigid body is distributed with respect to
the axis of rotation, we can define a new
parameter, the radius of gyration. It is related
to the moment of inertia and the total mass of
the body.
Notice from the Table 6.1 that in all
cases, we can write I = Mk2 , where k has
the dimension of length. For a rod, about
the perpendicular axis at its midpoint,
k 2 = L2 12 , i.e. k = L 12 . Similarly, k = R/2
for the circular disc about its diameter. The
length k is a geometric property of the body and
axis of rotation. It is called the radius of
gyration. The radius of gyration of a body
about an axis may be defined as the distance
from the axis of a mass point whose mass is
equal to the mass of the whole body and whose
moment of inertia is equal to the moment of
inertia of the body about the axis.
Thus, the moment of inertia of a rigid body
depends on the mass of the body, its shape and
size; distribution of mass about the axis of
rotation, and the position and orientation of the
axis of rotation.
From the definition, Eq. (6.34), we can infer
that the dimensions of moments of inertia are
ML2 and its SI units are kg m2.
The property of this extremely important
quantity I, as a measure of rotational inertia of
the body, has been put to a great practical use.
The machines, such as steam engine and the
automobile engine, etc., that produce rotational
motion have a disc with a large moment of
inertia, called a flywheel. Because of its large
moment of inertia, the flywheel resists the
sudden increase or decrease of the speed of the
vehicle. It allows a gradual change in the speed
and prevents jerky motions, thereby ensuring
a smooth ride for the passengers on the vehicle.

Comparing with Eq. (6.35) we get I = MR 2

of the system is M.

(b) Next, take a rigid rod of negligible mass of
length of length l with a pair of small masses,
rotating about an axis through the centre of
mass perpendicular to the rod (Fig. 6.28).
Each mass M/2 is at a distance l/2 from
the axis. The moment of inertia of the masses
is therefore given by
(M/2) (l/2)2 + (M/2)(l/2)2
Thus, for the pair of masses, rotating about
the axis through the centre of mass
perpendicular to the rod
I = Ml 2 / 4
Table 6.1 simply gives the moment of inertia of
various familiar regular shaped bodies about
specific axes. (The derivations of these
expressions are beyond the scope of this
textbook and you will study them in higher
classes.)
As the mass of a body resists a change in its
state of linear motion, it is a measure of its inertia
in linear motion. Similarly, as the moment of
inertia about a given axis of rotation resists a

In doing so we shall restrict the discussion only
to rotation about fixed axis. This case of motion
involves only one degree of freedom, i.e., needs
only one independent variable to describe the
motion. This in translation corresponds to linear



SYSTEMS OF PARTICLES AND ROTATIONAL MOTION

motion. This section is limited only to kinematics.
We shall turn to dynamics in later sections.
We recall that for specifying the angular
displacement of the rotating body we take any
particle like P (Fig.6.29) of the body. Its angular
displacement θ in the plane it moves is the
angular displacement of the whole body; θ is
measured from a fixed direction in the plane of
motion of P, which we take to be the x′-axis,
chosen parallel to the x-axis. Note, as shown,
the axis of rotation is the z – axis and the plane
of the motion of the particle is the x - y plane.
Fig. 6.29 also shows θ 0 , the angular
displacement at t = 0.
We also recall that the angular velocity is
the time rate of change of angular displacement,
ω = dθ/dt. Note since the axis of rotation is fixed,
there is no need to treat angular velocity as a
vector. Further, the angular acceleration, α =
dω/dt.
The kinematical quantities in rotational
motion, angular displacement (θ ), angular
velocity ( ω ) and angular acceleration ( α )
respectively are analogous to kinematic
quantities in linear motion, displacement (x ),
velocity (v) and acceleration (a). We know the
kinematical equations of linear motion with
uniform (i.e. constant) acceleration:
v = v0 + at

υ 2 = υ02 + 2ax

(c)

where x0 = initial displacement and v0= initial
velocity. The word ‘initial’ refers to values of the
quantities at t = 0
The corresponding kinematic equations for
rotational motion with uniform angular
acceleration are:

ω = ω0 + αt
θ = θ0 + ω 0t +

With the definition of ω = dθ/dt we may
integrate Eq. (6.36) to get Eq. (6.37). This
derivation and the derivation of Eq. (6.38) is left
as an exercise.

It is, however, necessary that these
correspondences are established on sound
dynamical considerations. This is what we now
turn to.
Before we begin, we note a simplification
that arises in the case of rotational motion
about a fixed axis. Since the axis is fixed, only
those components of torques, which are along
the direction of the fixed axis need to be
considered in our discussion. Only these
components can cause the body to rotate about
the axis. A component of the torque
perpendicular to the axis of rotation will tend to
turn the axis from its position. We specifically
assume that there will arise necessary forces of
constraint to cancel the effect of the
perpendicular components of the (external)
torques, so that the fixed position of the axis
will be maintained. The perpendicular
components of the torques, therefore need not
be taken into account. This means that for our
calculation of torques on a rigid body:
(1) We need to consider only those forces that
lie in planes perpendicular to the axis.
Forces which are parallel to the axis will give
torques perpendicular to the axis and need
not be taken into account.
(2) We need to consider only those components
of the position vectors which are
perpendicular to the axis. Components of
position vectors along the axis will result in
torques perpendicular to the axis and need
not be taken into account.
Work done by a torque

6.11 DYNAMICS OF ROTATIONAL MOTION
ABOUT A FIXED AXIS
Table 6.2 lists quantities associated with linear
motion and their analogues in rotational
motion. We have already compared kinematics
of the two motions. Also, we know that in
rotational motion moment of inertia and torque
play the same role as mass and force
respectively in linear motion. Given this we
should be able to guess what the other
analogues indicated in the table are. For
example, we know that in linear motion, work
done is given by F dx, in rotational motion about
a fixed axis it should be τ dθ , since we already
know the correspondence d x → dθ and F → τ .

Figure 6.30 shows a cross-section of a rigid
body rotating about a fixed axis, which is taken
as the z-axis (perpendicular to the plane of the
page; see Fig. 6.29). As said above we need to
consider only those forces which lie in planes
perpendicular to the axis. Let F1 be one such
typical force acting as shown on a particle of
the body at point P1 with its line of action in a
plane perpendicular to the axis. For convenience
we call this to be the x′–y′ plane (coincident
with the plane of the page). The particle at P1
describes a circular path of radius r1 with centre
C on the axis; CP1 = r1.
In time ∆t, the point moves to the position
P 1′ . The displacement of the particle ds 1 ,
therefore, has magnitude ds 1 = r 1 d θ and
direction tangential at P1 to the circular path
as shown. Here dθ is the angular displacement
of the particle, dθ = ∠P1CP1′ .The work done by
the force on the particle is
dW1 = F1. ds1= F1ds1 cosφ1= F1(r1 dθ)sinα1
where φ1 is the angle between F1 and the tangent
at P1, and α1 is the angle between F1 and the
radius vector OP1; φ1 + α1 = 90°.
The torque due to F1 about the origin is
OP 1 × F 1. Now OP 1 = OC + OP 1. [Refer to
Fig. 6.17(b).] Since OC is along the axis, the torque
resulting from it is excluded from our
consideration. The effective torque due to F1 is
τ1= CP × F1; it is directed along the axis of rotation
and has a magnitude τ1= r1F1 sinα , Therefore,
dW1 = τ1dθ

If there are more than one forces acting on
the body, the work done by all of them can be
added to give the total work done on the body.
Denoting the magnitudes of the torques due to
the different forces as τ1, τ2, … etc,
dW = (τ1 + τ 2 + ...) dθ

Remember, the forces giving rise to the
torques act on different particles, but the
angular displacement dθ is the same for all
particles. Since all the torques considered are
parallel to the fixed axis, the magnitude τ of the
total torque is just the algebraic sum of the
magnitudes of the torques, i.e., τ = τ1 + τ2 + .....
We, therefore, have
dW = τ dθ

(6.39)

This expression gives the work done by the
total (external) torque τ which acts on the body
rotating about a fixed axis. Its similarity with
the corresponding expression
dW= F ds
for linear (translational) motion is obvious.
Dividing both sides of Eq. (6.39) by dt gives
P =

motion. The work done by external torques is

therefore, not dissipated and goes on to increase
the kinetic energy of the body. The rate at which
work is done on the body is given by Eq. (6.40).
This is to be equated to the rate at which kinetic
energy increases. The rate of increase of kinetic
energy is

We assume that the moment of inertia does
not change with time. This means that the mass
of the body does not change, the body remains
rigid and also the axis does not change its
position with respect to the body.
Since α = dω /dt , we get

Just as force produces acceleration, torque
produces angular acceleration in a body. The
angular acceleration is directly proportional to
the applied torque and is inversely proportional
to the moment of inertia of the body. In this
respect, Eq.(6.41) can be called Newton’s second

6.12 ANGULAR MOMENTUM IN CASE OF
ROTATION ABOUT A FIXED AXIS

For computing the total angular momentum
of the whole rigid body, we add up the
contribution of each particle of the body.
Thus

We have studied in section 6.7, the angular
momentum of a system of particles. We already
know from there that the time rate of total
angular momentum of a system of particles
about a point is equal to the total external torque
on the system taken about the same point. When
the total external torque is zero, the total angular
momentum of the system is conserved.
We now wish to study the angular momentum
in the special case of rotation about a fixed axis.
The general expression for the total angular
momentum of the system of n particles is
N

L = ∑ ri × pi
i =1

(6.25b)

We first consider the angular momentum of
a typical particle of the rotating rigid body. We
then sum up the contributions of individual
particles to get L of the whole body.
For a typical particle l = r × p. As seen in the
last section r = OP = OC + CP [Fig. 6.17(b)]. With
p=mv,
l = ( OC × m v ) + (CP × m v )

The magnitude of the linear velocity v of the
particle at P is given by v = ωr⊥ where r⊥ is the
length of CP or the perpendicular distance of P
from the axis of rotation. Further, v is tangential
at P to the circle which the particle describes.
Using the right-hand rule one can check that
CP × v is parallel to the fixed axis. The unit
vector along the fixed axis (chosen as the z-axis)
is k̂ . Hence

ˆ
CP × m v = r⊥ (mv ) k

We denote by L ⊥ and L z the components of

L respectively perpendicular to the z-axis and
along the z-axis;
L ⊥ = ∑ OCi × m i vi

where mi and vi are respectively the mass and
the velocity of the ith particle and Ci is the centre
of the circle described by the particle;
and

ˆ
(6.42b)
Lz = Iω k
The last step follows since the perpendicular
distance of the ith particle from the axis is ri; and
by definition the moment of inertia of the body
or

about the axis of rotation is I = ∑ m i ri2 .
Note L = L z + L ⊥
(6.42c)
The rigid bodies which we have mainly
considered in this chapter are symmetric about
the axis of rotation, i.e. the axis of rotation is
one of their symmetry axes. For such bodies, for
a given OCi, for every particle which has a
velocity vi , there is another particle of velocity
–vi located diametrically opposite on the circle
with centre Ci described by the particle. Together
such pairs will contribute zero to L ⊥ and as a
result for symmetric bodies L ⊥ is zero, and
hence

ˆ
L = L z = Iωk

ˆ (since υ = ωr⊥ )
= mr⊥2ω k
Similarly, we can check that OC × v is
perpendicular to the fixed axis. Let us denote
the part of l along the fixed axis (i.e. the z-axis)
by lz, then

ˆ
l z = CP × m v = mr⊥2ω k
and l = l z + OC × m v
We note that lz is parallel to the fixed axis,
but l is not. In general, for a particle, the angular
momentum l is not along the axis of rotation,
i.e. for a particle, l and ω are not necessarily
parallel. Compare this with the corresponding
fact in translation. For a particle, p and v are
always parallel to each other.

(6.42a)

(6.42d)

For bodies, which are not symmetric about
the axis of rotation, L is not equal to Lz and hence
L does not lie along the axis of rotation.
Referring to Table 6.1, can you tell in which
cases L = Lz will not apply?
Let us differentiate Eq. (6.42b). Since k̂ is a
fixed (constant) vector, we get

fixed axis. This means we can take τ = τ k

We are now in a position to revisit the principle
of conservation of angular momentum in the
context of rotation about a fixed axis. From Eq.
(6.43c), if the external torque is zero,
(6.44)
Lz = Iω = constant
For symmetric bodies, from Eq. (6.42d), Lz
may be replaced by L .(L and Lz are respectively
the magnitudes of L and Lz.)
This then is the required form, for fixed axis
rotation, of Eq. (6.29a), which expresses the
general law of conservation of angular momentum
of a system of particles. Eq. (6.44) applies to many
situations that we come across in daily life. You
may do this experiment with your friend. Sit on a
swivel chair (a chair with a seat, free to rotate
about a pivot) with your arms folded and feet not
resting on, i.e., away from, the ground. Ask your
friend to rotate the chair rapidly. While the chair
is rotating with considerable angular speed
stretch your arms horizontally. What happens?
Your angular speed is reduced. If you bring back
your arms closer to your body, the angular speed
increases again. This is a situation where the
principle of conservation of angular momentum
is applicable. If friction in the rotational

mechanism is neglected, there is no external
torque about the axis of rotation of the chair and
hence Iω is constant. Stretching the arms
increases I about the axis of rotation, resulting in
decreasing the angular speed ω. Bringing the
arms closer to the body has the opposite effect.

A circus acrobat and a diver take advantage
of this principle. Also, skaters and classical,
Indian or western, dancers performing a
pirouette (a spinning about a tip–top) on the toes
of one foot display ‘mastery’ over this principle.

Ideally, a rigid body is one for which the distances between different particles of the
body do not change, even though there are forces on them.
A rigid body fixed at one point or along a line can have only rotational motion. A rigid
body not fixed in some way can have either pure translational motion or a combination
of translational and rotational motions.
In rotation about a fixed axis, every particle of the rigid body moves in a circle which
lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis and has its centre on the axis. Every Point in
the rotating rigid body has the same angular velocity at any instant of time.
In pure translation, every particle of the body moves with the same velocity at any
instant of time.
Angular velocity is a vector. Its magnitude is ω = dθ/dt and it is directed along the axis
of rotation. For rotation about a fixed axis, this vector ω has a fixed direction.
The vector or cross product of two vector a and b is a vector written as a× b. The
magnitude of this vector is absinθ and its direction is given by the right handed screw
or the right hand rule.
The linear velocity of a particle of a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis is given by
v = ω × r, where r is the position vector of the particle with respect to an origin along the
fixed axis. The relation applies even to more general rotation of a rigid body with one
point fixed. In that case r is the position vector of the particle with respect to the fixed
point taken as the origin.
The centre of mass of a system of n particles is defined as the point whose position
vector is

∑ m i ri

R=

M

Velocity of the centre of mass of a system of particles is given by V = P/M, where P is the
linear momentum of the system. The centre of mass moves as if all the mass of the
system is concentrated at this point and all the external forces act at it. If the total
external force on the system is zero, then the total linear momentum of the system is
constant.

To determine the motion of the centre of mass of a system no knowledge of internal
forces of the system is required. For this purpose we need to know only the external
forces on the body.
Separating the motion of a system of particles as the motion of the centre of mass, (i.e.,
the translational motion of the system) and motion about (i.e. relative to) the centre of
mass of the system is a useful technique in dynamics of a system of particles. One
example of this technique is separating the kinetic energy of a system of particles K as
the kinetic energy of the system about its centre of mass K′ and the kinetic energy of the
centre of mass MV2/2,
K = K′ + MV2/2
Newton’s Second Law for finite sized bodies (or systems of particles) is based in Newton’s
Second Law and also Newton’s Third Law for particles.
To establish that the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of
particles is the total external torque in the system, we need not only Newton’s second
law for particles, but also Newton’s third law with the provision that the forces between
any two particles act along the line joining the particles.
The vanishing of the total external force and the vanishing of the total external torque
are independent conditions. We can have one without the other. In a couple, total
external force is zero, but total torque is non-zero.
The total torque on a system is independent of the origin if the total external force is
zero.
The centre of gravity of a body coincides with its centre of mass only if the gravitational
field does not vary from one part of the body to the other.

The angular momentum L and the angular velocity ω are not necessarily parallel vectors.
However, for the simpler situations discussed in this chapter when rotation is about a
fixed axis which is an axis of symmetry of the rigid body, the relation L = Iω
ω holds good,
where I is the moment of the inertia of the body about the rotation axis.

Early in our lives, we become aware of the tendency of all
material objects to be attracted towards the earth. Anything
thrown up falls down towards the earth, going uphill is lot
more tiring than going downhill, raindrops from the clouds
above fall towards the earth and there are many other such
phenomena. Historically it was the Italian Physicist Galileo
(1564-1642) who recognised the fact that all bodies,
irrespective of their masses, are accelerated towards the earth
with a constant acceleration. It is said that he made a public
demonstration of this fact. To find the truth, he certainly
did experiments with bodies rolling down inclined planes and
arrived at a value of the acceleration due to gravity which is
close to the more accurate value obtained later.
A seemingly unrelated phenomenon, observation of stars,
planets and their motion has been the subject of attention
in many countries since the earliest of times. Observations
since early times recognised stars which appeared in the
sky with positions unchanged year after year. The more
interesting objects are the planets which seem to have regular
motions against the background of stars. The earliest
recorded model for planetary motions proposed by Ptolemy
about 2000 years ago was a ‘geocentric’ model in which all
celestial objects, stars, the sun and the planets, all revolved
around the earth. The only motion that was thought to be
possible for celestial objects was motion in a circle.
Complicated schemes of motion were put forward by Ptolemy
in order to describe the observed motion of the planets. The
planets were described as moving in circles with the centre
of the circles themselves moving in larger circles. Similar
theories were also advanced by Indian astronomers some
400 years later. However a more elegant model in which the
Sun was the centre around which the planets revolved – the
‘heliocentric’ model – was already mentioned by Aryabhatta
(5th century A.D.) in his treatise. A thousand years later, a
Polish monk named Nicolas Copernicus (1473-1543)



128

PHYSICS

proposed a definitive model in which the planets
moved in circles around a fixed central sun. His
theory was discredited by the church, but
notable amongst its supporters was Galileo who
had to face prosecution from the state for his
beliefs.
It was around the same time as Galileo, a
nobleman called Tycho Brahe (1546-1601)
hailing from Denmark, spent his entire lifetime
recording observations of the planets with the
naked eye. His compiled data were analysed
later by his assistant Johannes Kepler (15711640). He could extract from the data three
elegant laws that now go by the name of Kepler’s
laws. These laws were known to Newton and
enabled him to make a great scientific leap in
proposing his universal law of gravitation.
7.2 KEPLER’S LAWS
The three laws of Kepler can be stated as
follows:
1. Law of orbits : All planets move in elliptical
orbits with the Sun situated at one of the foci
B

P

S'

S

2b

of the ellipse (Fig. 7.1a). This law was a
deviation from the Copernican model which
allowed only circular orbits. The ellipse, of
which the circle is a special case, is a closed
curve which can be drawn very simply as
follows.
Select two points F1 and F2. Take a length
of a string and fix its ends at F1 and F2 by
pins. With the tip of a pencil stretch the string
taut and then draw a curve by moving the
pencil keeping the string taut throughout.(Fig.
7.1(b)) The closed curve you get is called an
ellipse. Clearly for any point T on the ellipse,
the sum of the distances from F1 and F2 is a
constant. F1, F 2 are called the focii. Join the
points F 1 and F 2 and extend the line to
intersect the ellipse at points P and A as shown
in Fig. 7.1(b). The midpoint of the line PA is
the centre of the ellipse O and the length PO =
AO is called the semi-major axis of the ellipse.
For a circle, the two focii merge into one and
the semi-major axis becomes the radius of the
circle.
2. Law of areas : The line that joins any planet
to the sun sweeps equal areas in equal
intervals of time (Fig. 7.2). This law comes from
the observations that planets appear to move
slower when they are farther from the sun
than when they are nearer.

3. Law of periods : The square of the time period
of revolution of a planet is proportional to the
cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse traced
out by the planet.

of revolution of eight* planets around the sun
along with values of their semi-major axes.

the law of areas. Gravitation is a central force
and hence the law of areas follows.
⊳ Example 7.1 Let the speed of the planet
at the perihelion P in Fig. 7.1(a) be vP and
the Sun-planet distance SP be rP. Relate
{rP, vP} to the corresponding quantities at
the aphelion {rA, vA}. Will the planet take
equal times to traverse BAC and CPB ?

Answer The magnitude of the angular
momentum at P is Lp = mp rp vp, since inspection
tells us that r p and v p are mutually
perpendicular. Similarly, LA = mp rA vA. From
angular momentum conservation
mp rp vp = mp rA vA

Since rA > rp, vp > vA .
The area SBAC bounded by the ellipse and
the radius vectors SB and SC is larger than SBPC
in Fig. 7.1. From Kepler’s second law, equal areas
are swept in equal times. Hence the planet will
take a longer time to traverse BAC than CPB.

The law of areas can be understood as a
consequence of conservation of angular
momentum whch is valid for any central
force . A central force is such that the force
on the planet is along the vector joining the
Sun and the planet. Let the Sun be at the
origin and let the position and momentum
of the planet be denoted by r and p
respectively. Then the area swept out by the
planet of mass m in time interval ∆ t is (Fig.
7.2) ∆ A given by
(7.1)
∆A = ½ (r × v∆t)
Hence
∆A /∆t =½ (r × p)/m, (since v = p/m)
= L / (2 m)
(7.2)
where v is the velocity, L is the angular
momentum equal to ( r × p). For a central
force, which is directed along r, L is a constant
as the planet goes around. Hence, ∆ A /∆t is a
constant according to the last equation. This is

7.3 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION
Legend has it that observing an apple falling from
a tree, Newton was inspired to arrive at an
universal law of gravitation that led to an
explanation of terrestrial gravitation as well as
of Kepler’s laws. Newton’s reasoning was that
the moon revolving in an orbit of radius Rm was
subject to a centripetal acceleration due to
earth’s gravity of magnitude
am =

4π 2 Rm
V2
=
Rm
T2

(7.3)

where V is the speed of the moon related to the
time period T by the relation V = 2π Rm / T . The
time period T is about 27.3 days and Rm was
already known then to be about 3.84 × 108m. If
we substitute these numbers in Eq. (7.3), we get
a value of am much smaller than the value of
acceleration due to gravity g on the surface of
the earth, arising also due to earth’s gravitational
attraction.



130

PHYSICS

This clearly shows that the force due to
earth’s gravity decreases with distance. If one
assumes that the gravitational force due to the
earth decreases in proportion to the inverse
square of the distance from the centre of the
−2

earth, we will have am α Rm
; g α R−
and we get
E

g

am RE

3600

(7.4)

in agreement with a value of g 9.8 m s-2 and
the value of am from Eq. (7.3). These observations
led Newton to propose the following Universal Law
of Gravitation :
Every body in the universe attracts every other
body with a force which is directly proportional
to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance
between them.
The quotation is essentially from Newton’s
famous treatise called ‘Mathematical Principles
of Natural Philosophy’ (Principia for short).
Stated Mathematically, Newton’s gravitation
law reads : The force F on a point mass m2 due
to another point mass m1 has the magnitude
|F | = G

m1 m 2
r2

The gravitational force is attractive, i.e., the
force F is along – r. The force on point mass m1
due to m2 is of course – F by Newton’s third law.
Thus, the gravitational force F12 on the body 1
due to 2 and F21 on the body 2 due to 1 are related
as F12 = – F21.
Before we can apply Eq. (7.5) to objects under
consideration, we have to be careful since the
law refers to point masses whereas we deal with
extended objects which have finite size. If we have
a collection of point masses, the force on any
one of them is the vector sum of the gravitational
forces exerted by the other point masses as
shown in Fig 7.4.

(b) Now if the mass at vertex A is doubled
then

cases, a simple law results when you do that :
(1) The force of attraction between a hollow
spherical shell of uniform density and a
point mass situated outside is just as if
the entire mass of the shell is
concentrated at the centre of the shell.
Qualitatively this can be understood as
follows: Gravitational forces caused by the
various regions of the shell have components
along the line joining the point mass to the
centre as well as along a direction
prependicular to this line. The components
prependicular to this line cancel out when
summing over all regions of the shell leaving
only a resultant force along the line joining
the point to the centre. The magnitude of
this force works out to be as stated above.
(2) The force of attraction due to a hollow
spherical shell of uniform density, on a
point mass situated inside it is zero.
Qualitatively, we can again understand this
result. Various regions of the spherical shell
attract the point mass inside it in various
directions. These forces cancel each other
completely.
7.4 THE GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT
The value of the gravitational constant G entering
the Universal law of gravitation can be
determined experimentally and this was first done
by English scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798.
The apparatus used by him is schematically
shown in Fig.7.6

⊳
For the gravitational force between an extended
object (like the earth) and a point mass, Eq. (7.5) is not
directly applicable. Each point mass in the extended
object will exert a force on the given point mass and
these force will not all be in the same direction. We
have to add up these forces vectorially for all the point
masses in the extended object to get the total force.
This is easily done using calculus. For two special

Fig. 7.6

Schematic drawing of Cavendish’s
experiment. S1 and S2 are large spheres
which are kept on either side (shown
shades) of the masses at A and B. When
the big spheres are taken to the other side
of the masses (shown by dotted circles),
the bar AB rotates a little since the torque
reverses direction. The angle of rotation can
be measured experimentally.



132

PHYSICS

The bar AB has two small lead spheres
attached at its ends. The bar is suspended from
a rigid support by a fine wire. Two large lead
spheres are brought close to the small ones but
on opposite sides as shown. The big spheres
attract the nearby small ones by equal and
opposite force as shown. There is no net force
on the bar but only a torque which is clearly
equal to F times the length of the bar,where F is
the force of attraction between a big sphere and
its neighbouring small sphere. Due to this
torque, the suspended wire gets twisted till such
time as the restoring torque of the wire equals
the gravitational torque . If θ is the angle of twist
of the suspended wire, the restoring torque is
proportional to θ, equal to τθ. Where τ is the
restoring couple per unit angle of twist. τ can be
measured independently e.g. by applying a
known torque and measuring the angle of twist.
The gravitational force between the spherical
balls is the same as if their masses are
concentrated at their centres. Thus if d is the
separation between the centres of the big and
its neighbouring small ball, M and m their
masses, the gravitational force between the big
sphere and its neighouring small ball is.

all the shells exert a gravitational force at the
point outside just as if their masses are
concentrated at their common centre according
to the result stated in section 7.3. The total mass
of all the shells combined is just the mass of the
earth. Hence, at a point outside the earth, the
gravitational force is just as if its entire mass of
the earth is concentrated at its centre.
For a point inside the earth, the situation
is different. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.7.

Mm
(7.6)
d2
If L is the length of the bar AB , then the
torque arising out of F is F multiplied by L. At
equilibrium, this is equal to the restoring torque
and hence

Again consider the earth to be made up of
concentric shells as before and a point mass m
situated at a distance r from the centre. The
point P lies outside the sphere of radius r. For
the shells of radius greater than r, the point P
lies inside. Hence according to result stated in
the last section, they exert no gravitational force
on mass m kept at P. The shells with radius ≤ r
make up a sphere of radius r for which the point
P lies on the surface. This smaller sphere
therefore exerts a force on a mass m at P as if
its mass Mr is concentrated at the centre. Thus
the force on the mass m at P has a magnitude

F =G

Mm
L =τ θ

d2
Observation of θ thus enables one to
calculate G from this equation.

Acceleration g is readily measurable. RE is a

with knowledge of g and RE enables one to

7.6 ACCELERATION DUE TO GRAVITY BELOW
AND ABOVE THE SURFACE OF EARTH

Equation (7.15) thus tells us that for small
heights h above the value of g decreases by a

Consider a point mass m at a height h above the
surface of the earth as shown in Fig. 7.8(a). The
radius of the earth is denoted by RE . Since this
point is outside the earth,

factor (1 − 2h / RE ).
Now, consider a point mass m at a depth
d below the surface of the earth (Fig. 7.8(b)),
so that its distance from the centre of the

earth is ( RE − d ) as shown in the figure. The
earth can be thought of as being composed
of a smaller sphere of radius (R E – d ) and a
spherical shell of thickness d. The force on
m due to the outer shell of thickness d is
zero because the result quoted in the
previous section. As far as the smaller
sphere of radius ( R E – d ) is concerned, the
point mass is outside it and hence according
to the result quoted earlier, the force due to
this smaller sphere is just as if the entire
mass of the smaller sphere is concentrated
at the centre. If Ms is the mass of the smaller
sphere, then,
Ms/ME = ( RE – d)3 / RE3
( 7.16)
Since mass of a sphere is proportional to be
cube of its radius.

sphere of radius (RE–d) contributes to g.

Thus the force on the point mass is
F (d) = G Ms m / (RE – d ) 2

(7.17)

Substituting for Ms from above , we get
F (d) = G ME m ( RE – d ) / RE3
(7.18)
and hence the acceleration due to gravity at

Thus, as we go down below earth’s surface,
the acceleration due gravity decreases by a factor

(1 − d / RE ). The remarkable thing about
acceleration due to earth’s gravity is that it is
maximum on its surface decreasing whether you
go up or down.
7.7 GRAVITATIONAL POTENTIAL ENERGY
We had discussed earlier the notion of potential
energy as being the energy stored in the body at
its given position. If the position of the particle
changes on account of forces acting on it, then
the change in its potential energy is just the
amount of work done on the body by the force.
As we had discussed earlier, forces for which the
work done is independent of the path are the
conservative forces.
The force of gravity is a conservative force
and we can calculate the potential energy of a
body arising out of this force, called the
gravitational potential energy. Consider points

close to the surface of earth, at distances from
the surface much smaller than the radius of the
earth. In such cases, the force of gravity is
practically a constant equal to mg, directed
towards the centre of the earth. If we consider a
point at a height h1 from the surface of the earth
and another point vertically above it at a height
h2 from the surface, the work done in lifting the
particle of mass m from the first to the second
position is denoted by W12
W12 = Force × displacement
(7.20)
= mg (h2 – h1)
If we associate a potential energy W(h) at a
point at a height h above the surface such that
W(h) = mgh + Wo
(7.21)
(where Wo = constant) ;
then it is clear that
W12 = W(h2) – W(h1)
(7.22)
The work done in moving the particle is just
the difference of potential energy between its
final and initial positions.Observe that the
constant Wo cancels out in Eq. (7.22). Setting h
= 0 in the last equation, we get W ( h = 0 ) = Wo.
. h = 0 means points on the surface of the earth.
Thus, Wo is the potential energy on the surface
of the earth.
If we consider points at arbitrary distance
from the surface of the earth, the result just
derived is not valid since the assumption that
the gravitational force mg is a constant is no
longer valid. However, from our discussion we
know that a point outside the earth, the force of
gravitation on a particle directed towards the
centre of the earth is

G ME m
(7.23)
r2
where ME = mass of earth, m = mass of the
particle and r its distance from the centre of the
earth. If we now calculate the work done in
lifting a particle from r = r1 to r = r2 (r2 > r1) along
a vertical path, we get instead of Eq. (7.20)
F=

W12 = ∫

In place of Eq. (7.21), we can thus associate
a potential energy W(r) at a distance r, such that

+ W1 ,
(7.25)
r
valid for r > R ,
so that once again W12 = W(r 2 ) – W(r 1).
Setting r = infinity in the last equation, we get
W ( r = infinity ) = W1 . Thus, W1 is the potential
energy at infinity. One should note that only the
difference of potential energy between two points
has a definite meaning from Eqs. (7.22) and
(7.24). One conventionally sets W1 equal to zero,
so that the potential energy at a point is just the
amount of work done in displacing the particle
from infinity to that point.
We have calculated the potential energy at
a point of a particle due to gravitational forces
on it due to the earth and it is proportional to
the mass of the particle. The gravitational
potential due to the gravitational force of the
earth is defined as the potential energy of a
particle of unit mass at that point. From the
earlier discussion, we learn that the gravitational
potential energy associated with two particles
of masses m1 and m2 separated by distance by a
distance r is given by
W (r ) = −

V =–

It should be noted that an isolated system of
particles will have the total potential energy that
equals the sum of energies (given by the above
equation) for all possible pairs of its constituent
particles. This is an example of the application
of the superposition principle.

a system of four particles placed at the
vertices of a square of side l. Also obtain
the potential at the centre of the square.
Answer Consider four masses each of mass m

7.8 ESCAPE SPEED
If a stone is thrown by hand, we see it falls back
to the earth. Of course using machines we can
shoot an object with much greater speeds and
with greater and greater initial speed, the object
scales higher and higher heights. A natural
query that arises in our mind is the following:
‘can we throw an object with such high initial
speeds that it does not fall back to the earth?’
The principle of conservation of energy helps
us to answer this question. Suppose the object
did reach infinity and that its speed there was
Vf . The energy of an object is the sum of potential
and kinetic energy. As before W1 denotes that
gravitational potential energy of the object at
infinity. The total energy of the projectile at
infinity then is

E ( ∞) = W1 +

mV f2

(7.26)

If the object was thrown initially with a speed

centre of the earth (RE = radius of the earth), its
energy initially was

Example 7.4 Two uniform solid spheres
of equal radii R, but mass M and 4 M have
a centre to centre separation 6 R, as shown
in Fig. 7.10. The two spheres are held fixed.
A projectile of mass m is projected from the
surface of the sphere of mass M directly
towards the centre of the second sphere.
Obtain an expression for the minimum
speed v of the projectile so that it reaches
the surface of the second sphere.

(7.28)

The R.H.S. is a positive quantity with a
minimum value zero hence so must be the L.H.S.
Thus, an object can reach infinity as long as Vi
is such that

(7.29)

The minimum value of Vi corresponds to the
case when the L.H.S. of Eq. (7.29) equals zero.

to reach infinity (i.e. escape from the earth)
corresponds to

Answer The projectile is acted upon by two
mutually opposing gravitational forces of the two
spheres. The neutral point N (see Fig. 7.10) is
defined as the position where the two forces
cancel each other exactly. If ON = r, we have
GMm

(7.31)

Using the relation g = GM E / RE2 , we get

(Vi )min =

Fig. 7.10

(7.32)

Using the value of g and RE, numerically
(Vi) min≈11.2 km/s. This is called the escape
speed, sometimes loosely called the escape
velocity.
Equation (7.32) applies equally well to an
object thrown from the surface of the moon with
g replaced by the acceleration due to Moon’s
gravity on its surface and rE replaced by the
radius of the moon. Both are smaller than their
values on earth and the escape speed for the
moon turns out to be 2.3 km/s, about five times
smaller. This is the reason that moon has no
atmosphere. Gas molecules if formed on the
surface of the moon having velocities larger than
this will escape the gravitational pull of the
moon.

The neutral point r = – 6R does not concern
us in this example. Thus ON = r = 2R. It is
sufficient to project the particle with a speed
which would enable it to reach N. Thereafter,
the greater gravitational pull of 4M would
suffice. The mechanical energy at the surface

7.9 EARTH SATELLITES
Earth satellites are objects which revolve around
the earth. Their motion is very similar to the
motion of planets around the Sun and hence
Kepler’s laws of planetary motion are equally
applicable to them. In particular, their orbits
around the earth are circular or elliptic. Moon is
the only natural satellite of the earth with a near
circular orbit with a time period of approximately
27.3 days which is also roughly equal to the
rotational period of the moon about its own axis.
Since, 1957, advances in technology have enabled
many countries including India to launch artificial
earth satellites for practical use in fields like
telecommunication, geophysics and meteorology.
We will consider a satellite in a circular orbit
of a distance (RE + h ) from the centre of the earth,
where RE = radius of the earth. If m is the mass
of the satellite and V its speed, the centripetal
force required for this orbit is
F(centripetal) =

mV 2
(RE + h )

time period T therefore is

on substitution of value of V from Eq. (7.35).
Squaring both sides of Eq. (7.37), we get
T 2 = k ( RE + h)3 (where k = 4 π2 / GME)

which is Kepler’s law of periods, as applied to
motion of satellites around the earth. For a
satellite very close to the surface of earth h can
be neglected in comparison to RE in Eq. (7.38).
Hence, for such satellites, T is To, where

radius of 9.4 ×103 km. Calculate the mass
of mars. (ii) Assume that earth and mars
move in circular orbits around the sun,
with the martian orbit being 1.52 times

The total energy of an circularly orbiting
satellite is thus negative, with the potential
energy being negative but twice is magnitude of
the positive kinetic energy.
When the orbit of a satellite becomes
elliptic, both the K.E. and P.E. vary from point
to point. The total energy which remains
constant is negative as in the circular orbit case.
This is what we expect, since as we have
discussed before if the total energy is positive or
zero, the object escapes to infinity. Satellites
are always at finite distance from the earth and
hence their energies cannot be positive or zero.

SUMMARY
1. Newton’s law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force of attraction between
any two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r has the magnitude

F =G

m 1m 2
r

2

where G is the universal gravitational constant, which has the value 6.672 ×10–11 N m2 kg–2.
2. If we have to find the resultant gravitational force acting on the particle m due to a number of
masses M1, M2, ….Mn etc. we use the principle of superposition. Let F1, F2, ….Fn be the individual
forces due to M1, M2, ….Mn, each given by the law of gravitation. From the principle of superposition
each force acts independently and uninfluenced by the other bodies. The resultant force FR is
then found by vector addition
n

FR = F1 + F2 + ……+ Fn =

∑ Fi
i =1

where the symbol ‘Σ’ stands for summation.
3. Kepler’s laws of planetary motion state that
(a) All planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one of the focal points
(b) The radius vector drawn from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time
intervals. This follows from the fact that the force of gravitation on the planet is central
and hence angular momentum is conserved.
(c) The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major
axis of the elliptical orbit of the planet
The period T and radius R of the circular orbit of a planet about the Sun are related
by

5. The gravitational force is a conservative force, and therefore a potential energy function can be
defined. The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance
r is given by
G m1 m 2
r
where V is taken to be zero at r → ∞. The total potential energy for a system of particles is the
sum of energies for all pairs of particles, with each pair represented by a term of the form given
by above equation. This prescription follows from the principle of superposition.

9. If a particle is outside a uniform spherical shell or solid sphere with a spherically symmetric
internal mass distribution, the sphere attracts the particle as though the mass of the sphere or
shell were concentrated at the centre of the sphere.
10. If a particle is inside a uniform spherical shell, the gravitational force on the particle is zero. If a
particle is inside a homogeneous solid sphere, the force on the particle acts toward the centre of the
sphere. This force is exerted by the spherical mass interior to the particle.

POINTS TO PONDER
1. In considering motion of an object under the gravitational influence of another object
the following quantities are conserved:
(a) Angular momentum
(b) Total mechanical energy
Linear momentum is not conserved
2. Angular momentum conservation leads to Kepler’s second law. However, it is not special
to the inverse square law of gravitation. It holds for any central force.
3. In Kepler’s third law (see Eq. (7.1) and T2 = KS R3. The constant KS is the same for all
planets in circular orbits. This applies to satellites orbiting the Earth [(Eq. (7.38)].
4. An astronaut experiences weightlessness in a space satellite. This is not because the
gravitational force is small at that location in space. It is because both the astronaut
and the satellite are in “free fall” towards the Earth.
5. The gravitational potential energy associated with two particles separated by a distance
r is given by

V =–

G m1 m 2
+ constant
r

The constant can be given any value. The simplest choice is to take it to be zero. With
this choice

V =–

G m1 m 2
r

This choice implies that V → 0 as r → ∞. Choosing location of zero of the gravitational
energy is the same as choosing the arbitrary constant in the potential energy. Note that
the gravitational force is not altered by the choice of this constant.
6. The total mechanical energy of an object is the sum of its kinetic energy (which is always
positive) and the potential energy. Relative to infinity (i.e. if we presume that the potential
energy of the object at infinity is zero), the gravitational potential energy of an object is
negative. The total energy of a satellite is negative.
7. The commonly encountered expression m g h for the potential energy is actually an
approximation to the difference in the gravitational potential energy discussed in the
point 6, above.
8. Although the gravitational force between two particles is central, the force between two
finite rigid bodies is not necessarily along the line joining their centre of mass. For a
spherically symmetric body however the force on a particle external to the body is as if
the mass is concentrated at the centre and this force is therefore central.
9. The gravitational force on a particle inside a spherical shell is zero. However, (unlike a
metallic shell which shields electrical forces) the shell does not shield other bodies outside
it from exerting gravitational forces on a particle inside. Gravitational shielding is not
possible.

EXERCISES
Answer the following :
(a) You can shield a charge from electrical forces by putting it inside a hollow conductor.
Can you shield a body from the gravitational influence of nearby matter by putting
it inside a hollow sphere or by some other means ?
(b) An astronaut inside a small space ship orbiting around the earth cannot detect
gravity. If the space station orbiting around the earth has a large size, can he hope
to detect gravity ?
(c) If you compare the gravitational force on the earth due to the sun to that due
to the moon, you would find that the Sun’s pull is greater than the moon’s pull.
(you can check this yourself using the data available in the succeeding exercises).
However, the tidal effect of the moon’s pull is greater than the tidal effect of sun.
Why ?

(d) The formula –G Mm(1/r 2 – 1/r 1 ) is more/less accurate than the formula

7.5 Let us assume that our galaxy consists of 2.5 × 1011 stars each of one solar mass. How
long will a star at a distance of 50,000 ly from the galactic centre take to complete one
revolution ? Take the diameter of the Milky Way to be 105 ly.
7.6 Choose the correct alternative:
(a) If the zero of potential energy is at infinity, the total energy of an orbiting satellite
is negative of its kinetic/potential energy.
(b) The energy required to launch an orbiting satellite out of earth’s gravitational
influence is more/less than the energy required to project a stationary object at
the same height (as the satellite) out of earth’s influence.

9.15

Fig (a) is incorrect [Reason: at a constriction (i.e. where the area of cross-section of the
tube is smaller), flow speed is larger due to mass conservation. Consequently pressure
there is smaller according to Bernoulli’s equation. We assume the fluid to be
incompressible].

Excess pressure = 310 Pa, total pressure = 1.0131 × 105 Pa. However, since data are
correct to three significant figures, we should write total pressure inside the drop as
1.01 × 105 Pa.

9.20

Excess pressure inside the soap bubble = 20.0 Pa; excess pressure inside the air bubble
in soap solution = 10.0 Pa. Outside pressure for air bubble = 1.01 × 105 + 0.4 × 103 × 9.8

10.5

(a) TA = 392.69 K, TB = 391.98 K; (b) The discrepancy arises because the gases are not
perfectly ideal. To reduce the discrepancy, readings should be taken for lower and
lower pressures and the plot between temperature measured versus absolute pressure
of the gas at triple point should be extrapolated to obtain temperature in the limit
pressure tends to zero, when the gases approach ideal gas behaviour.

Actual length of the rod at 45.0 °C = (63.0 + 0.0136) cm = 63.0136 cm. (However, we

10.15 The gases are diatomic, and have other degrees of freedom (i.e. have other modes of
motion) possible besides the translational degrees of freedom. To raise the temperature
of the gas by a certain amount, heat is to be supplied to increase the average energy of
all the modes. Consequently, molar specific heat of diatomic gases is more than that of
monatomic gases. It can be shown that if only rotational modes of motion are considered,
the molar specific heat of diatomic gases is nearly (5/2) R which agrees with the
observations for all the gases listed in the table, except chlorine. The higher value of
molar specific heat of chlorine indicates that besides rotational modes, vibrational modes
are also present in chlorine at room temperature.

Foreword
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 recommends that children’s life
at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a
departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our
system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi
and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this
basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of
sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will
take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education
outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and
teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to
pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,
time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information
passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of
examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning
are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat
children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change is school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the
annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted
to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how
effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience,
rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address
the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at
different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available
for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher
priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in
small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates
the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for
this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science
and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,
Professor A.W. Joshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers
contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals
for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and
personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring
Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education,
Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor
Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution.
As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement
in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which
will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

Rationalisation of Content in the Textbooks
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on
students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content
load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset.
In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the
textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT
across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.
Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:


Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same
class



Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject



Difficulty level



Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from
teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning



Content, which is irrelevant in the present context

This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes
given above.

Preface
More than a decade ago, based on National Policy of Education (NPE-1986),
National Council of Educational Research and Training published physics
textbooks for Classes XI and XII, prepared under the chairmanship of
Professor T. V. Ramakrishnan, F.R.S., with the help of a team of learned co-authors.
The books were well received by the teachers and students alike. The books, in
fact, proved to be milestones and trend-setters. However, the development of
textbooks, particularly science books, is a dynamic process in view of the changing
perceptions, needs, feedback and the experiences of the students, educators and
the society. Another version of the physics books, which was the result of the
revised syllabus based on National Curriculum Framework for School Education-2000
(NCFSE-2000), was brought out under the guidance of Professor Suresh Chandra,
which continued up to now. Recently the NCERT brought out the National
Curriculum Framework-2005 (NCF-2005), and the syllabus was accordingly revised
during a curriculum renewal process at school level. The higher secondary stage
syllabus (NCERT, 2005) has been developed accordingly. The Class XI textbook
contains fifteen chapters in two parts. Part I contains first eight chapters while
Part II contains next seven chapters. This book is the result of the renewed efforts
of the present Textbook Development Team with the hope that the students will
appreciate the beauty and logic of physics. The students may or may not continue
to study physics beyond the higher secondary stage, but we feel that they will find
the thought process of physics useful in any other branch they may like to pursue,
be it finance, administration, social sciences, environment, engineering, technology,
biology or medicine. For those who pursue physics beyond this stage, the matter
developed in these books will certainly provide a sound base.
Physics is basic to the understanding of almost all the branches of science
and technology. It is interesting to note that the ideas and concepts of physics are
increasingly being used in other branches such as economics and commerce, and
behavioural sciences too. We are conscious of the fact that some of the underlying
simple basic physics principles are often conceptually quite intricate. In this book,
we have tried to bring in a conceptual coherence. The pedagogy and the use of
easily understandable language are at the core of our effort without sacrificing the
rigour of the subject. The nature of the subject of physics is such that a certain
minimum use of mathematics is a must. We have tried to develop the mathematical
formulations in a logical fashion, as far as possible.
Students and teachers of physics must realise that physics is a branch which
needs to be understood, not necessarily memorised. As one goes from secondary
to higher secondary stage and beyond, physics involves mainly four components,
(a) large amount of mathematical base, (b) technical words and terms, whose
normal English meanings could be quite different, (c) new intricate concepts,
and (d) experimental foundation. Physics needs mathematics because we wish to
develop objective description of the world around us and express our observations
in terms of measurable quantities. Physics discovers new properties of particles
and wants to create a name for each one. The words are picked up normally from
common English or Latin or Greek, but gives entirely different meanings to these
words. It would be illuminating to look up words like energy, force, power, charge,
spin, and several others, in any standard English dictionary, and compare their



Prelims.indd 7

viii
meanings with their physics meanings. Physics develops intricate and often
weird-looking concepts to explain the behaviour of particles. Finally, it must be
remembered that entire physics is based on observations and experiments, without
which a theory does not get acceptance into the domain of physics.
This book has some features which, we earnestly hope, will enhance its
usefulness for the students. Each chapter is provided with a Summary at its end
for a quick overview of the contents of the chapter. This is followed by Points to
Ponder which points out the likely misconceptions arising in the minds of students,
hidden implications of certain statements/principles given in the chapter and
cautions needed in applying the knowledge gained from the chapter. They also
raise some thought-provoking questions which would make a student think about
life beyond physics. Students will find it interesting to think and apply their mind
on these points. Further, a large number of solved examples are included in the
text in order to clarify the concepts and/or to illustrate the application of these
concepts in everyday real-life situations. Occasionally, historical perspective has
been included to share the excitement of sequential development of the subject
of physics. Some Boxed items are introduced in many chapters either for this
purpose or to highlight some special features of the contents requiring additional
attention of the learners. Finally, a Subject Index has been added at the end of
the book for ease in locating keywords in the book.
The special nature of physics demands, apart from conceptual understanding,
the knowledge of certain conventions, basic mathematical tools, numerical values
of important physical constants, and systems of measurement units covering a
vast range from microscopic to galactic levels. In order to equip the students, we
have included the necessary tools and database in the form of Appendices A-1
to A-9 at the end of the book. There are also some other appendices at the end of
some chapters giving additional information or applications of matter discussed
in that chapter.
Special attention has been paid for providing illustrative figures. To increase the
clarity, the figures are drawn in two colours. A large number of Exercises are given
at the end of each chapter. Some of these are from real-life situations. Students are
urged to solve these and in doing so, they may find them very educative. Moreover,
some Additional Exercises are given which are more challenging. Answers and
hints to solve some of these are also included. In the entire book, SI units have
been used. A comprehensive account of ‘units and measurement’ is given in Chapter 2 as
a part of prescribed syllabus/curriculum as well as a help in their pursuit of physics.
A box-item in this chapter brings out the difficulty in measuring as simple a thing as
the length of a long curved line. Tables of SI base units and other related units are
given here merely to indicate the presently accepted definitions and to indicate the
high degree of accuracy with which measurements are possible today. The numbers
given here are not to be memorised or asked in examinations.
There is a perception among students, teachers, as well as the general public
that there is a steep gradient between secondary and higher secondary stages.
But a little thought shows that it is bound to be there in the present scenario of
education. Education up to secondary stage is general education where a student
has to learn several subjects – sciences, social sciences, mathematics, languages, at
an elementary level. Education at the higher secondary stage and beyond, borders
on acquiring professional competence, in some chosen fields of endeavour. You
may like to compare this with the following situation. Children play cricket or
badminton in lanes and small spaces outside (or inside) their homes. But then

some of them want to make it to the school team, then district team, then State
team and then the National team. At every stage, there is bound to be a steep
gradient. Hard work would have to be put in whether students want to pursue
their education in the area of sciences, humanities, languages, music, fine arts,
commerce, finance, architecture, or if they want to become sportspersons or
fashion designers.
Completing this book has only been possible because of the spontaneous
and continuous support of many people. The Textbook Development Team is
thankful to Dr. V. H. Raybagkar for allowing us to use his box item in Chapter
4 and to Dr. F. I. Surve for allowing us to use two of his box items in Chapter
15. We express also our gratitude to the Director, NCERT, for entrusting
us with the task of preparing this textbook as a part of national effort for
improving science education. The Head, Department of Education in Science
and Mathematics, NCERT, was always willing to help us in our endeavour in
every possible way.
The previous text got excellent academic inputs from teachers, students and
experts who sincerely suggested improvement during the past few years. We are
thankful to all those who conveyed these inputs to NCERT. We are also thankful to
the members of the Review Workshop and Editing Workshop organised to discuss
and refine the first draft. We thank the Chairmen and their teams of authors for the
text written by them in 1988, which provided the base and reference for developing
the 2002 version as well as the present version of the textbook. Occasionally,
substantial portions from the earlier versions, particularly those appreciated by
students/teachers, have been adopted/adapted and retained in the present book
for the benefit of coming generation of learners.
We welcome suggestions and comments from our valued users, especially
students and teachers. We wish our young readers a happy journey to the exciting
realm of physics.

The strong nuclear force binds protons and
neutrons in a nucleus and is the strongest of
nature’s four fundamental forces. A mystery
surrounding the strong nuclear force has been
solved. The three quarks within the proton can
sometimes appear to be free, although no free
quarks have ever been observed. The quarks
have a quantum mechanical property called
‘colour’ and interact with each other through
the exchange of particles called ‘gluons’
— nature glue.

A Note for the Teachers
To make the curriculum learner-centred, students should be made to participate and interact
in the learning process directly. Once a week or one out of every six classes would be a good
periodicity for such seminars and mutual interaction. Some suggestions for making the discussion
participatory are given below, with reference to some specific topics in this book.
Students may be divided into groups of five to six. The membership of these groups may be
rotated during the year, if felt necessary.
The topic for discussion can be presented on the board or on slips of paper. Students should
be asked to write their reactions or answers to questions, whichever is asked, on the given sheets.
They should then discuss in their groups and add modifications or comments in those sheets. These
should be discussed either in the same or in a different class. The sheets may also be evaluated.
We suggest here three possible topics from the book. The first two topics suggested are, in
fact, very general and refer to the development of science over the past four centuries or more.
Students and teachers may think of more such topics for each seminar.
1. Ideas that changed civilisation
Suppose human beings are becoming extinct. A message has to be left for future generations
or alien visitors. Eminent physicist R P Feynmann wanted the following message left for future
beings, if any.
“Matter is made up of atoms”
A lady student and teacher of literature, wanted the following message left:
“Water existed, so human beings could happen”.
Another person thought it should be: “Idea of wheel for motion”
Write down what message each one of you would like to leave for future generations. Then
discuss it in your group and add or modify, if you want to change your mind. Give it to your
teacher and join in any discussion that follows.
2. Reductionism
Kinetic Theory of Gases relates the Big to the Small, the Macro to the Micro. A gas as a system
is related to its components, the molecules. This way of describing a system as a result of the
properties of its components is usually called Reductionism. It explains the behaviour of the
group by the simpler and predictable behaviour of individuals. Macroscopic observations and
microscopic properties have a mutual interdependence in this approach. Is this method useful?
This way of understanding has its limitations outside physics and chemistry, may be even in
these subjects. A painting cannot be discussed as a collection of the properties of chemicals used
in making the canvas and the painting. What emerges is more than the sum of its components.
Question: Can you think of other areas where such an approach is used?
Describe briefly a system which is fully describable in terms of its components. Describe
one which is not. Discuss with other members of the group and write your views. Give it to your
teacher and join in any discussion that may follow.
3. Molecular approach to heat
Describe what you think will happen in the following case. An enclosure is separated by a porous
wall into two parts. One is filled with nitrogen gas (N2) and the other with CO2. Gases will diffuse
from one side to the other.
Question 1: Will both gases diffuse to the same extent? If not, which will diffuse more. Give reasons.
Question 2: Will the pressure and temperature be unchanged? If not, what will be the changes
in both. Give reasons.
Write down your answers. Discuss with the group and modify them or add comments.
Give to the teacher and join in the discussion.
Students and teachers will find that such seminars and discussions lead to tremendous
understanding, not only of physics, but also of science and social sciences. They also bring in
some maturity among students.

INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 6, we studied the rotation of the bodies and then
realised that the motion of a body depends on how mass is
distributed within the body. We restricted ourselves to simpler
situations of rigid bodies. A rigid body generally means a
hard solid object having a definite shape and size. But in
reality, bodies can be stretched, compressed and bent. Even
the appreciably rigid steel bar can be deformed when a
sufficiently large external force is applied on it. This means
that solid bodies are not perfectly rigid.
A solid has definite shape and size. In order to change (or
deform) the shape or size of a body, a force is required. If
you stretch a helical spring by gently pulling its ends, the
length of the spring increases slightly. When you leave the
ends of the spring, it regains its original size and shape. The
property of a body, by virtue of which it tends to regain its
original size and shape when the applied force is removed, is
known as elasticity and the deformation caused is known
as elastic deformation. However, if you apply force to a lump
of putty or mud, they have no gross tendency to regain their
previous shape, and they get permanently deformed. Such
substances are called plastic and this property is called
plasticity. Putty and mud are close to ideal plastics.
The elastic behaviour of materials plays an important role
in engineering design. For example, while designing a
building, knowledge of elastic properties of materials like steel,
concrete etc. is essential. The same is true in the design of
bridges, automobiles, ropeways etc. One could also ask —
Can we design an aeroplane which is very light but
sufficiently strong? Can we design an artificial limb which
is lighter but stronger? Why does a railway track have a
particular shape like I? Why is glass brittle while brass is
not? Answers to such questions begin with the study of how
relatively simple kinds of loads or forces act to deform
different solids bodies. In this chapter, we shall study the



168

PHYSICS

elastic behaviour and mechanical properties of
solids which would answer many such
questions.
8.2 STRESS AND STRAIN
When forces are applied on a body in such a
manner that the body is still in static equilibrium,
it is deformed to a small or large extent depending
upon the nature of the material of the body and
the magnitude of the deforming force. The
deformation may not be noticeable visually in
many materials but it is there. When a body is
subjected to a deforming force, a restoring force
is developed in the body. This restoring force is
equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to
the applied force. The restoring force per unit area
is known as stress. If F is the force applied normal
to the cross–section and A is the area of cross
section of the body,
Magnitude of the stress = F/A
(8.1)
The SI unit of stress is N m–2 or pascal (Pa)
and its dimensional formula is [ ML–1T–2 ].
There are three ways in which a solid may
change its dimensions when an external force
acts on it. These are shown in Fig. 8.1. In
Fig.8.1(a), a cylinder is stretched by two equal
forces applied normal to its cross-sectional area.
The restoring force per unit area in this case is
called tensile stress. If the cylinder is
compressed under the action of applied forces,
the restoring force per unit area is known as
compressive stress. Tensile or compressive
stress can also be termed as longitudinal stress.
In both the cases, there is a change in the
length of the cylinder. The change in the length
∆L to the original length L of the body (cylinder
in this case) is known as longitudinal strain.

(a)

Fig. 8.1

Longitudinal strain =

∆L
L

(8.2)

However, if two equal and opposite deforming
forces are applied parallel to the cross-sectional
area of the cylinder, as shown in Fig. 8.1(b),
there is relative displacement between the
opposite faces of the cylinder. The restoring force
per unit area developed due to the applied
tangential force is known as tangential or
shearing stress.
As a result of applied tangential force, there
is a relative displacement ∆x between opposite
faces of the cylinder as shown in the Fig. 8.1(b).
The strain so produced is known as shearing
strain and it is defined as the ratio of relative
displacement of the faces ∆x to the length of the
cylinder L.
Shearing strain =

∆x
= tan θ
L

(8.3)

where θ is the angular displacement of the
cylinder from the vertical (original position of the
cylinder). Usually θ is very small, tan θ
is nearly equal to angle θ , (if θ = 10°, for
example, there is only 1% difference between θ
and tan θ).
It can also be visualised, when a book is
pressed with the hand and pushed horizontally,
as shown in Fig. 8.2 (c).
Thus, shearing strain = tan θ ≈ θ
(8.4)
In Fig. 8.1 (d), a solid sphere placed in the fluid
under high pressure is compressed uniformly on
all sides. The force applied by the fluid acts in
perpendicular direction at each point of the
surface and the body is said to be under
hydraulic compression. This leads to decrease

in its volume without any change of its
geometrical shape.
The body develops internal restoring forces
that are equal and opposite to the forces applied
by the fluid (the body restores its original shape
and size when taken out from the fluid). The
internal restoring force per unit area in this case
is known as hydraulic stress and in magnitude
is equal to the hydraulic pressure (applied force
per unit area).
The strain produced by a hydraulic pressure
is called volume strain and is defined as the
ratio of change in volume (∆V) to the original
volume (V ).
Volume strain =

∆V
V

compression and shear stress may also be
obtained. The stress-strain curves vary from
material to material. These curves help us to
understand how a given material deforms with
increasing loads. From the graph, we can see
that in the region between O to A, the curve is
linear. In this region, Hooke’s law is obeyed.
The body regains its original dimensions when
the applied force is removed. In this region, the
solid behaves as an elastic body.

(8.5)

Since the strain is a ratio of change in
dimension to the original dimension, it has no
units or dimensional formula.
8.3 HOOKE’S LAW
Stress and strain take different forms in the
situations depicted in the Fig. (8.1). For small
deformations the stress and strain are
proportional to each other. This is known as
Hooke’s law.
Thus,
stress ∝ strain
stress = k × strain
(8.6)
where k is the proportionality constant and is
known as modulus of elasticity.
Hooke’s law is an empirical law and is found
to be valid for most materials. However, there
are some materials which do not exhibit this
linear relationship.
8.4 STRESS-STRAIN CURVE
The relation between the stress and the strain
for a given material under tensile stress can be
found experimentally. In a standard test of
tensile properties, a test cylinder or a wire is
stretched by an applied force. The fractional
change in length (the strain) and the applied
force needed to cause the strain are recorded.
The applied force is gradually increased in steps
and the change in length is noted. A graph is
plotted between the stress (which is equal in
magnitude to the applied force per unit area) and
the strain produced. A typical graph for a metal
is shown in Fig. 8.2. Analogous graphs for

Fig. 8.2 A typical stress-strain curve for a metal.

In the region from A to B, stress and strain
are not proportional. Nevertheless, the body still
returns to its original dimension when the load
is removed. The point B in the curve is known
as yield point (also known as elastic limit) and
the corresponding stress is known as yield
strength (σy ) of the material.
If the load is increased further, the stress
developed exceeds the yield strength and strain
increases rapidly even for a small change in the
stress. The portion of the curve between B and
D shows this. When the load is removed, say at
some point C between B and D, the body does
not regain its original dimension. In this case,
even when the stress is zero, the strain is not
zero. The material is said to have a permanent
set. The deformation is said to be plastic
deformation. The point D on the graph is the
ultimate tensile strength (σu ) of the material.
Beyond this point, additional strain is produced
even by a reduced applied force and fracture
occurs at point E. If the ultimate strength and
fracture points D and E are close, the material
is said to be brittle. If they are far apart, the
material is said to be ductile.



170

PHYSICS

8.5 ELASTIC MODULI
The proportional region within the elastic limit
of the stress-strain curve (region OA in Fig. 8.2)
is of great importance for structural and
manufacturing engineering designs. The ratio
of stress and strain, called modulus of elasticity,
is found to be a characteristic of the material.
8.5.1 Young’s Modulus

Fig. 8.3

Stress-strain curve for the elastic tissue of
Aorta, the large tube (vessel) carrying blood
from the heart.

As stated earlier, the stress-strain behaviour
varies from material to material. For example,
rubber can be pulled to several times its original
length and still returns to its original shape. Fig.
8.3 shows stress-strain curve for the elastic
tissue of aorta, present in the heart. Note that
although elastic region is very large, the material
does not obey Hooke’s law over most of the region.
Secondly, there is no well defined plastic region.
Substances like tissue of aorta, rubber etc.
which can be stretched to cause large strains
are called elastomers.

Experimental observation show that for a given
material, the magnitude of the strain produced
is same whether the stress is tensile or
compressive. The ratio of tensile (or compressive)
stress (σ ) to the longitudinal strain (ε) is defined as
Young’s modulus and is denoted by the symbol Y.
Y=

σ
ε

(8.7)

From Eqs. (8.1) and (8.2), we have
Y = (F/A)/(∆L/L)
(8.8)
= (F × L) /(A × ∆L)
Since strain is a dimensionless quantity, the
unit of Young’s modulus is the same as that of
stress i.e., N m–2 or Pascal (Pa). Table 8.1 gives
the values of Young’s moduli and yield strengths
of some material.
From the data given in Table 8.1, it is noticed
that for metals Young’s moduli are large.

Therefore, these materials require a large force
to produce small change in length. To increase
the length of a thin steel wire of 0.1 cm2 crosssectional area by 0.1%, a force of 2000 N is
required. The force required to produce the same
strain in aluminium, brass and copper wires
having the same cross-sectional area are 690 N,
900 N and 1100 N respectively. It means that
steel is more elastic than copper, brass and
aluminium. It is for this reason that steel is
preferred in heavy-duty machines and in
structural designs. Wood, bone, concrete and
glass have rather small Young’s moduli.
u Example 8.1 A structural steel rod has a
radius of 10 mm and a length of 1.0 m. A
100 kN force stretches it along its length.
Calculate (a) stress, (b) elongation, and (c)
strain on the rod. Young’s modulus, of
structural steel is 2.0 × 1011 N m-2.

Answer We assume that the rod is held by a
clamp at one end, and the force F is applied at
the other end, parallel to the length of the rod.
Then the stress on the rod is given by

Answer The copper and steel wires are under
a tensile stress because they have the same
tension (equal to the load W) and the same area
of cross-section A. From Eq. (8.7) we have stress
= strain × Young’s modulus. Therefore
W/A = Yc × (∆Lc/Lc) = Ys × (∆Ls/Ls)
where the subscripts c and s refer to copper

∆Lc/∆Ls = (Ys/Yc) × (Lc/Ls)
Given Lc = 2.2 m, Ls = 1.6 m,
From Table 9.1 Yc = 1.1 × 1011 N.m–2, and
Ys = 2.0 × 1011 N.m–2.

∆Lc/∆Ls = (2.0 × 10 /1.1 × 1011) × (2.2/1.6) = 2.5.
The total elongation is given to be
∆Lc + ∆Ls = 7.0 × 10-4 m
Solving the above equations,
∆Lc = 5.0 × 10-4 m, and ∆Ls = 2.0 × 10-4 m.

who is lying on his back (as shown in Fig.

performing the act, and the tables, plaques
etc. involved is 280 kg. The mass of the
performer lying on his back at the bottom of
the pyramid is 60 kg. Each thighbone (femur)

Answer Total mass of all the performers, tables,
plaques etc.
= 280 kg
Mass of the performer = 60 kg
Mass supported by the legs of the performer
at the bottom of the pyramid
= 280 – 60 = 220 kg
Weight of this supported mass
= 220 kg wt. = 220 × 9.8 N = 2156 N.
Weight supported by each thighbone of the
performer = ½ (2156) N = 1078 N.
From Table 9.1, the Young’s modulus for bone
is given by
Y
=
9.4 × 109 N m–2.
Length of each thighbone L = 0.5 m
the radius of thighbone = 2.0 cm
Thus the cross-sectional area of the thighbone
A = π × (2 × 10-2)2 m2 = 1.26 × 10-3 m2.
Using Eq. (9.8), the compression in each
thighbone (∆L) can be computed as
∆L = [(F × L)/(Y × A)]
= [(1078 × 0.5)/(9.4 × 109 × 1.26 × 10-3)]
= 4.55 × 10-5 m or 4.55 × 10-3 cm.
This is a very small change! The fractional
decrease in the thighbone is ∆L/L = 0.000091 or
0.0091%.
⊳
8.5.2 Shear Modulus
The ratio of shearing stress to the corresponding
shearing strain is called the shear modulus of
the material and is represented by G. It is also
called the modulus of rigidity.
G = shearing stress (σs)/shearing strain
G = (F/A)/(∆x/L)
= (F × L)/(A × ∆x)
(8.10)
Similarly, from Eq. (9.4)
G = (F/A)/θ
= F/(A × θ)
(8.11)
The shearing stress σs can also be expressed as
(8.12)
σs = G × θ
SI unit of shear modulus is N m–2 or Pa. The
shear moduli of a few common materials are
given in Table 9.2. It can be seen that shear
modulus (or modulus of rigidity) is generally less
than Young’s modulus (from Table 9.1). For most
materials G ≈ Y/3.

u Example 8.4 A square lead slab of side 50
cm and thickness 10 cm is subject to a
shearing force (on its narrow face) of 9.0 ×
104 N. The lower edge is riveted to the floor.
How much will the upper edge be displaced?

Answer The lead slab is fixed and the force is
applied parallel to the narrow face as shown in
Fig. 8.6. The area of the face parallel to which
this force is applied is
A = 50 cm × 10 cm
= 0.5 m × 0.1 m
= 0.05 m2
Therefore, the stress applied is
= (9.4 × 104 N/0.05 m2)
= 1.80 × 106 N.m–2

We know that shearing strain = (∆x/L)= Stress /G.
Therefore the displacement ∆x = (Stress × L)/G

= 1.6 × 10–4 m = 0.16 mm

8.5.3 Bulk Modulus
In Section (8.3), we have seen that when a body
is submerged in a fluid, it undergoes a hydraulic
stress (equal in magnitude to the hydraulic
pressure). This leads to the decrease in the
volume of the body thus producing a strain called
volume strain [Eq. (8.5)]. The ratio of hydraulic
stress to the corresponding hydraulic strain is
called bulk modulus. It is denoted by symbol B.
B = – p/(∆V/V)
(8.12)
The negative sign indicates the fact that with
an increase in pressure, a decrease in volume
occurs. That is, if p is positive, ∆V is negative.
Thus for a system in equilibrium, the value of
bulk modulus B is always positive. SI unit of
bulk modulus is the same as that of pressure
i.e., N m–2 or Pa. The bulk moduli of a few common
materials are given in Table 8.3.
The reciprocal of the bulk modulus is called
compressibility and is denoted by k. It is defined
as the fractional change in volume per unit
increase in pressure.
k = (1/B) = – (1/∆p) × (∆V/V)
(8.13)
It can be seen from the data given in Table
8.3 that the bulk moduli for solids are much
larger than for liquids, which are again much
larger than the bulk modulus for gases (air).

Thus, solids are the least compressible, whereas,
gases are the most compressible. Gases are about
a million times more compressible than solids!
Gases have large compressibilities, which vary
with pressure and temperature. The
incompressibility of the solids is primarily due
to the tight coupling between the neighbouring
atoms. The molecules in liquids are also bound
with their neighbours but not as strong as in
solids. Molecules in gases are very poorly
coupled to their neighbours.
Table 8.4 shows the various types of stress,
strain, elastic moduli, and the applicable state
of matter at a glance.
u Example 8.5 The average depth of Indian
Ocean is about 3000 m. Calculate the
fractional compression, ∆V/V, of water at
the bottom of the ocean, given that the bulk
modulus of water is 2.2 × 109 N m–2. (Take
g = 10 m s–2)

Answer The pressure exerted by a 3000 m
column of water on the bottom layer
p = hρ g = 3000 m × 1000 kg m–3 × 10 m s–2
= 3 × 107 kg m–1 s-2
= 3 × 107 N m–2
Fractional compression ∆V/V, is
∆V/V = stress/B = (3 × 107 N m-2)/(2.2 × 109 N m–2)
= 1.36 × 10-2 or 1.36 %

8.5.5 Elastic Potential Energy
in a Stretched Wire
When a wire is put under a tensile stress, work
is done against the inter-atomic forces. This
work is stored in the wire in the form of elastic
potential energy. When a wire of original length
L and area of cross-section A is subjected to a
deforming force F along the length of the wire,
let the length of the wire be elongated by l. Then
from Eq. (8.8), we have F = YA × (l/L). Here Y is
the Young’s modulus of the material of the wire.
Now for a further elongation of infinitesimal
small length dl, work done dW is F × dl or YAldl/
L. Therefore, the amount of work done (W) in
increasing the length of the wire from L to L + l,
that is from l = 0 to l = l is
W= ∫

8.5.4 POISSON’S RATIO

u=

The strain perpendicular to the applied force is
called lateral strain. Simon Poisson pointed out
that within the elastic limit, lateral strain is
directly proportional to the longitudinal strain.
The ratio of the lateral strain to the longitudinal
strain in a stretched wire is called Poisson’s
ratio. If the original diameter of the wire is d
and the contraction of the diameter under stress
is ∆d, the lateral strain is ∆d/d. If the original
length of the wire is L and the elongation under
stress is ∆L, the longitudinal strain is ∆L/L.
Poisson’s ratio is then (∆d/d)/(∆L/L) or (∆d/∆L)
× (L/d). Poisson’s ratio is a ratio of two strains;
it is a pure number and has no dimensions or
units. Its value depends only on the nature of
material. For steels the value is between 0.28 and
0.30, and for aluminium alloys it is about 0.33.

APPLICATIONS OF ELASTIC
BEHAVIOUR OF MATERIALS

The elastic behaviour of materials plays an
important role in everyday life. All engineering
designs require precise knowledge of the elastic
behaviour of materials. For example while
designing a building, the structural design of
the columns, beams and supports require
knowledge of strength of materials used. Have
you ever thought why the beams used in
construction of bridges, as supports etc. have
a cross-section of the type I? Why does a heap
of sand or a hill have a pyramidal shape?
Answers to these questions can be obtained
from the study of structural engineering which
is based on concepts developed here.

Cranes used for lifting and moving heavy loads
from one place to another have a thick metal
rope to which the load is attached. The rope is
pulled up using pulleys and motors. Suppose we
want to make a crane, which has a lifting
capacity of 10 tonnes or metric tons (1 metric
ton = 1000 kg). How thick should the steel rope
be? We obviously want that the load does not
deform the rope permanently. Therefore, the
extension should not exceed the elastic limit.
From Table 8.1, we find that mild steel has a
yield strength (σy) of about 300 × 106 N m–2. Thus,
the area of cross-section (A) of the rope should
at least be
A ≥ W/σy = Mg/σy
(8.15)
= (104 kg × 9.8 m s-2)/(300 × 106 N m-2)
= 3.3 × 10-4 m2
corresponding to a radius of about 1 cm for a
rope of circular cross-section. Generally a
large margin of safety (of about a factor of ten
in the load) is provided. Thus a thicker rope of
radius about 3 cm is recommended. A single
wire of this radius would practically be a rigid
rod. So the ropes are always made of a number
of thin wires braided together, like in pigtails,
for ease in manufacture, flexibility and strength.
A bridge has to be designed such that it can
withstand the load of the flowing traffic, the force
of winds and its own weight. Similarly, in the
design of buildings the use of beams and columns
is very common. In both the cases, the
overcoming of the problem of bending of beam
under a load is of prime importance. The beam
should not bend too much or break. Let us
consider the case of a beam loaded at the centre
and supported near its ends as shown in
Fig. 8.6. A bar of length l, breadth b, and depth
d when loaded at the centre by a load W sags by
an amount given by

δ = W l 3/(4bd 3Y)

Fig. 8.6

This relation can be derived using what you
have already learnt and a little calculus. From
Eq. (8.16), we see that to reduce the bending
for a given load, one should use a material with
a large Young’s modulus Y. For a given material,
increasing the depth d rather than the breadth
b is more effective in reducing the bending, since
δ is proportional to d -3 and only to b-1(of course
the length l of the span should be as small as
possible). But on increasing the depth, unless
the load is exactly at the right place (difficult to
arrange in a bridge with moving traffic), the
deep bar may bend as shown in Fig. 8.7(b). This
is called buckling. To avoid this, a common
compromise is the cross-sectional shape shown
in Fig. 8.7(c). This section provides a large loadbearing surface and enough depth to prevent
bending. This shape reduces the weight of the
beam without sacrificing the strength and
hence reduces the cost.

The use of pillars or columns is also very
common in buildings and bridges. A pillar with
rounded ends as shown in Fig. 8.9(a) supports
less load than that with a distributed shape at
the ends [Fig. 8.9(b)]. The precise design of a
bridge or a building has to take into account
the conditions under which it will function, the
cost and long period, reliability of usable
material, etc.

The answer to the question why the maximum
height of a mountain on earth is ~10 km can
also be provided by considering the elastic
properties of rocks. A mountain base is not under
uniform compression and this provides some

shearing stress to the rocks under which they
can flow. The stress due to all the material on
the top should be less than the critical shearing
stress at which the rocks flow.
At the bottom of a mountain of height h, the
force per unit area due to the weight of the
mountain is hρg where ρ is the density of the
material of the mountain and g is the acceleration
due to gravity. The material at the bottom
experiences this force in the vertical direction,
and the sides of the mountain are free. Therefore,
this is not a case of pressure or bulk compression.
There is a shear component, approximately hρg
itself. Now the elastic limit for a typical rock is
30 × 107 N m-2 . Equating this to hρg, with
ρ = 3 × 103 kg m-3 gives
hρg = 30 × 107 N m-2 .
h
= 30 × 107 N m-2/(3 × 103 kg m-3 × 10 m s-2)
= 10 km
which is more than the height of Mt. Everest!

SUMMARY

5.

Stress is the restoring force per unit area and strain is the fractional change in dimension.
In general there are three types of stresses (a) tensile stress — longitudinal stress
(associated with stretching) or compressive stress (associated with compression),
(b) shearing stress, and (c) hydraulic stress.
For small deformations, stress is directly proportional to the strain for many materials.
This is known as Hooke’s law. The constant of proportionality is called modulus of
elasticity. Three elastic moduli viz., Young’s modulus, shear modulus and bulk modulus
are used to describe the elastic behaviour of objects as they respond to deforming forces
that act on them.
A class of solids called elastomers does not obey Hooke’s law.
When an object is under tension or compression, the Hooke’s law takes the form
F/A = Y∆L/L
where ∆L/L is the tensile or compressive strain of the object, F is the magnitude of the
applied force causing the strain, A is the cross-sectional area over which F is applied
(perpendicular to A) and Y is the Young’s modulus for the object. The stress is F/A.
A pair of forces when applied parallel to the upper and lower faces, the solid deforms so
that the upper face moves sideways with respect to the lower. The horizontal displacement
∆L of the upper face is perpendicular to the vertical height L. This type of deformation is
called shear and the corresponding stress is the shearing stress. This type of stress is
possible only in solids.
In this kind of deformation the Hooke’s law takes the form
F/A = G × ∆L/L
where ∆L is the displacement of one end of object in the direction of the applied force F,
and G is the shear modulus.
When an object undergoes hydraulic compression due to a stress exerted by a surrounding
fluid, the Hooke’s law takes the form
p = B (∆V/V),
where p is the pressure (hydraulic stress) on the object due to the fluid, ∆V/V (the
volume strain) is the absolute fractional change in the object’s volume due to that
pressure and B is the bulk modulus of the object.

POINTS TO PONDER
1.

In the case of a wire, suspended from celing and stretched under the action of a weight (F)
suspended from its other end, the force exerted by the ceiling on it is equal and opposite to
the weight. However, the tension at any cross-section A of the wire is just F and not 2F.
Hence, tensile stress which is equal to the tension per unit area is equal to F/A.

2.

Hooke’s law is valid only in the linear part of stress-strain curve.

3.

The Young’s modulus and shear modulus are relevant only for solids since only solids
have lengths and shapes.

4.

Bulk modulus is relevant for solids, liquid and gases. It refers to the change in volume
when every part of the body is under the uniform stress so that the shape of the body
remains unchanged.

5.

Metals have larger values of Young’s modulus than alloys and elastomers. A material
with large value of Young’s modulus requires a large force to produce small changes in its
length.

6.

In daily life, we feel that a material which stretches more is more elastic, but it a is
misnomer. In fact material which stretches to a lesser extent for a given load is considered
to be more elastic.

7.

In general, a deforming force in one direction can produce strains in other directions
also. The proportionality between stress and strain in such situations cannot be described
by just one elastic constant. For example, for a wire under longitudinal strain, the
lateral dimensions (radius of cross section) will undergo a small change, which is described
by another elastic constant of the material (called Poisson ratio).

8.

Stress is not a vector quantity since, unlike a force, the stress cannot be assigned a
specific direction. Force acting on the portion of a body on a specified side of a section
has a definite direction.

In this chapter, we shall study some common physical
properties of liquids and gases. Liquids and gases can flow
and are therefore, called fluids. It is this property that
distinguishes liquids and gases from solids in a basic way.
Fluids are everywhere around us. Earth has an envelop of
air and two-thirds of its surface is covered with water. Water
is not only necessary for our existence; every mammalian
body constitute mostly of water. All the processes occurring
in living beings including plants are mediated by fluids. Thus
understanding the behaviour and properties of fluids is
important.
How are fluids different from solids? What is common in
liquids and gases? Unlike a solid, a fluid has no definite
shape of its own. Solids and liquids have a fixed volume,
whereas a gas fills the entire volume of its container. We
have learnt in the previous chapter that the volume of solids
can be changed by stress. The volume of solid, liquid or gas
depends on the stress or pressure acting on it. When we
talk about fixed volume of solid or liquid, we mean its volume
under atmospheric pressure. The difference between gases
and solids or liquids is that for solids or liquids the change
in volume due to change of external pressure is rather small.
In other words solids and liquids have much lower
compressibility as compared to gases.
Shear stress can change the shape of a solid keeping its
volume fixed. The key property of fluids is that they offer
very little resistance to shear stress; their shape changes by
application of very small shear stress. The shearing stress
of fluids is about million times smaller than that of solids.
9.2 PRESSURE
A sharp needle when pressed against our skin pierces it. Our
skin, however, remains intact when a blunt object with a
wider contact area (say the back of a spoon) is pressed against
it with the same force. If an elephant were to step on a man’s
chest, his ribs would crack. A circus performer across whose



MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS

181

chest a large, light but strong wooden plank is
placed first, is saved from this accident. Such
everyday experiences convince us that both the
force and its coverage area are important. Smaller
the area on which the force acts, greater is the
impact. This impact is known as pressure.
When an object is submerged in a fluid at
rest, the fluid exerts a force on its surface. This
force is always normal to the object’s surface.
This is so because if there were a component of
force parallel to the surface, the object will also
exert a force on the fluid parallel to it; as a
consequence of Newton’s third law. This force
will cause the fluid to flow parallel to the surface.
Since the fluid is at rest, this cannot happen.
Hence, the force exerted by the fluid at rest has
to be perpendicular to the surface in contact
with it. This is shown in Fig.9.1(a).
The normal force exerted by the fluid at a point
may be measured. An idealised form of one such
pressure-measuring device is shown in Fig.
9.1(b). It consists of an evacuated chamber with
a spring that is calibrated to measure the force
acting on the piston. This device is placed at a
point inside the fluid. The inward force exerted
by the fluid on the piston is balanced by the
outward spring force and is thereby measured.

In principle, the piston area can be made
arbitrarily small. The pressure is then defined
in a limiting sense as

Pressure is a scalar quantity. We remind the
reader that it is the component of the force
normal to the area under consideration and not
the (vector) force that appears in the numerator
in Eqs. (9.1) and (9.2). Its dimensions are
[ML–1T–2]. The SI unit of pressure is N m–2. It has
been named as pascal (Pa) in honour of the
French scientist Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) who
carried out pioneering studies on fluid pressure.
A common unit of pressure is the atmosphere
(atm), i.e. the pressure exerted by the
atmosphere at sea level (1 atm = 1.013 × 105 Pa).
Another quantity, that is indispensable in
describing fluids, is the density ρ. For a fluid of
mass m occupying volume V,

ρ=

The dimensions of density are [ML ]. Its SI
unit is kg m–3. It is a positive scalar quantity. A
liquid is largely incompressible and its density
is therefore, nearly constant at all pressures.
Gases, on the other hand exhibit a large
variation in densities with pressure.
The density of water at 4 o C (277 K) is
1.0 × 10 3 kg m–3. The relative density of a
substance is the ratio of its density to the
density of water at 4oC. It is a dimensionless
positive scalar quantity. For example the relative
density of aluminium is 2.7. Its density is
2.7 × 103 kg m–3. The densities of some common
fluids are displayed in Table 9.1.

9.2.1 Pascal’s Law
The French scientist Blaise Pascal observed that
the pressure in a fluid at rest is the same at all
points if they are at the same height. This fact
may be demonstrated in a simple way.

this element of area corresponding to the normal
forces Fa, Fb and Fc as shown in Fig. 9.2 on the
faces BEFC, ADFC and ADEB denoted by Aa, Ab
and Ac respectively. Then
Fb sinθ = Fc,
Fb cosθ = Fa (by equilibrium)
Ab sinθ = Ac, Ab cosθ = Aa (by geometry)
Thus,

Ab Ac Aa

Pb = Pc = Pa

(9.4)

Hence, pressure exerted is same in all
directions in a fluid at rest. It again reminds us
that like other types of stress, pressure is not a
vector quantity. No direction can be assigned
to it. The force against any area within (or
bounding) a fluid at rest and under pressure is
normal to the area, regardless of the orientation
of the area.
Now consider a fluid element in the form of a
horizontal bar of uniform cross-section. The bar
is in equilibrium. The horizontal forces exerted
at its two ends must be balanced or the
pressure at the two ends should be equal. This
proves that for a liquid in equilibrium the
pressure is same at all points in a horizontal
plane. Suppose the pressure were not equal in
different parts of the fluid, then there would be
a flow as the fluid will have some net force
acting on it. Hence in the absence of flow the
pressure in the fluid must be same everywhere
in a horizontal plane.
9.2.2 Variation of Pressure with Depth

Proof of Pascal’s law. ABC-DEF is an
element of the interior of a fluid at rest.
This element is in the form of a rightangled prism. The element is small so that
the effect of gravity can be ignored, but it
has been enlarged for the sake of clarity.

Fig. 9.2 shows an element in the interior of a
fluid at rest. This element ABC-DEF is in the
form of a right-angled prism. In principle, this
prismatic element is very small so that every
part of it can be considered at the same depth
from the liquid surface and therefore, the effect
of the gravity is the same at all these points.
But for clarity we have enlarged this element.
The forces on this element are those exerted by
the rest of the fluid and they must be normal to
the surfaces of the element as discussed above.
Thus, the fluid exerts pressures Pa, Pb and Pc on

Consider a fluid at rest in a container. In
Fig. 9.3 point 1 is at height h above a point 2.
The pressures at points 1 and 2 are P1 and P2
respectively. Consider a cylindrical element of
fluid having area of base A and height h. As the
fluid is at rest the resultant horizontal forces
should be zero and the resultant vertical forces
should balance the weight of the element. The
forces acting in the vertical direction are due to
the fluid pressure at the top (P 1A) acting
downward, at the bottom (P2A) acting upward.
If mg is weight of the fluid in the cylinder we
have
(P2 − P1) A = mg
(9.5)
Now, if ρ is the mass density of the fluid, we
have the mass of fluid to be m = ρV= ρhA so
that
P2 − P1= ρgh

Fig.9.3

Fluid under gravity. The effect of gravity is
illustrated through pressure on a vertical
cylindrical column.

Pressure difference depends on the vertical
distance h between the points (1 and 2), mass
density of the fluid ρ and acceleration due to
gravity g. If the point 1 under discussion is
shifted to the top of the fluid (say, water), which
is open to the atmosphere, P1 may be replaced
by atmospheric pressure (Pa) and we replace P2
by P. Then Eq. (9.6) gives
P = Pa + ρgh

(9.7)

Thus, the pressure P, at depth below the
surface of a liquid open to the atmosphere is
greater than atmospheric pressure by an
amount ρgh. The excess of pressure, P − Pa, at
depth h is called a gauge pressure at that point.
The area of the cylinder is not appearing in
the expression of absolute pressure in Eq. (9.7).
Thus, the height of the fluid column is important
and not cross-sectional or base area or the shape
of the container. The liquid pressure is the same
at all points at the same horizontal level (same
depth). The result is appreciated through the
example of hydrostatic paradox. Consider three
vessels A, B and C [Fig.9.4] of different shapes.
They are connected at the bottom by a horizontal
pipe. On filling with water, the level in the three
vessels is the same, though they hold different
amounts of water. This is so because water at
the bottom has the same pressure below each
section of the vessel.

Illustration of hydrostatic paradox. The
three vessels A, B and C contain different
amounts of liquids, all upto the same
height.

Example 9.2 What is the pressure on a
swimmer 10 m below the surface of a lake?

Answer Here
h = 10 m and ρ = 1000 kg m-3. Take g = 10 m s–2
From Eq. (9.7)
P = Pa + ρgh
= 1.01 × 105 Pa + 1000 kg m–3 × 10 m s–2 × 10 m
= 2.01 × 105 Pa
≈ 2 atm
This is a 100% increase in pressure from
surface level. At a depth of 1 km, the increase
in pressure is 100 atm! Submarines are designed
to withstand such enormous pressures.

Atmospheric Pressure and
Gauge Pressure

The pressure of the atmosphere at any point is
equal to the weight of a column of air of unit
cross-sectional area extending from that point
to the top of the atmosphere. At sea level, it is
1.013 × 10 5 Pa (1 atm). Italian scientist
Evangelista Torricelli (1608 –1647) devised for
the first time a method for measuring
atmospheric pressure. A long glass tube closed
at one end and filled with mercury is inverted
into a trough of mercury as shown in Fig.9.5 (a).
This device is known as ‘mercury barometer’.
The space above the mercury column in the tube
contains only mercury vapour whose pressure
P is so small that it may be neglected. Thus,
the pressure at Point A=0. The pressure inside
the coloumn at Point B must be the same as the
pressure at Point C, which is atmospheric
pressure, Pa.
Pa = ρgh
(9.8)
where ρ is the density of mercury and h is the
height of the mercury column in the tube.

Fig 9.5 Two pressure measuring devices.

Pressure is same at the same level on both
sides of the U-tube containing a fluid. For
liquids, the density varies very little over wide
ranges in pressure and temperature and we can
treat it safely as a constant for our present
purposes. Gases on the other hand, exhibits
large variations of densities with changes in
pressure and temperature. Unlike gases, liquids
are, therefore, largely treated as incompressible.
⊳

In the experiment it is found that the mercury
column in the barometer has a height of about
76 cm at sea level equivalent to one atmosphere
(1 atm). This can also be obtained using the
value of ρ in Eq. (9.8). A common way of stating
pressure is in terms of cm or mm of mercury
(Hg). A pressure equivalent of 1 mm is called a
torr (after Torricelli).
1 torr = 133 Pa.
The mm of Hg and torr are used in medicine
and physiology. In meteorology, a common unit
is the bar and millibar.
1 bar = 105 Pa
An open tube manometer is a useful
instrument for measuring pressure differences.
It consists of a U-tube containing a suitable
liquid i.e., a low density liquid (such as oil) for
measuring small pressure differences and a
high density liquid (such as mercury) for large
pressure differences. One end of the tube is open
to the atmosphere and the other end is
connected to the system whose pressure we want
to measure [see Fig. 9.5 (b)]. The pressure P at A
is equal to pressure at point B. What we
normally measure is the gauge pressure, which
is P − Pa, given by Eq. (9.8) and is proportional to
manometer height h.

Example 9.3 The density of the
atmosphere at sea level is 1.29 kg/m3.
Assume that it does not change with
altitude. Then how high would the
atmosphere extend?

Answer We use Eq. (9.7)
ρgh = 1.29 kg m–3 × 9.8 m s2 × h m = 1.01 × 105 Pa
∴ h = 7989 m ≈ 8 km
In reality the density of air decreases with
height. So does the value of g. The atmospheric
cover extends with decreasing pressure over
100 km. We should also note that the sea level
atmospheric pressure is not always 760 mm of
Hg. A drop in the Hg level by 10 mm or more is a
sign of an approaching storm.

transmitting pressure. In a hydraulic lift, as
shown in Fig. 9.6 (b), two pistons are separated
by the space filled with a liquid. A piston of small
cross-section A1 is used to exert a force F1 directly

on the liquid. The pressure P = A is

transmitted throughout the liquid to the larger
cylinder attached with a larger piston of area A2,
which results in an upward force of P × A2.

Let us now consider what happens when we
change the pressure on a fluid contained in a
vessel. Consider a horizontal cylinder with a
piston and three vertical tubes at different points
[Fig. 9.6 (a)]. The pressure in the horizontal
cylinder is indicated by the height of liquid
column in the vertical tubes. It is necessarily
the same in all. If we push the piston, the fluid
level rises in all the tubes, again reaching the
same level in each one of them.

behind the hydraulic lift, a device used
to lift heavy loads.

This indicates that when the pressure on the
cylinder was increased, it was distributed
uniformly throughout. We can say whenever
external pressure is applied on any part of a
fluid contained in a vessel, it is transmitted
undiminished and equally in all directions.
This is another form of the Pascal’s law and it
has many applications in daily life.
A number of devices, such as hydraulic lift

important advantage of the system is that the

9.3 STREAMLINE FLOW
So far we have studied fluids at rest. The study
of the fluids in motion is known as fluid
dynamics. When a water tap is turned on slowly,
the water flow is smooth initially, but loses its
smoothness when the speed of the outflow is
increased. In studying the motion of fluids, we
focus our attention on what is happening to
various fluid particles at a particular point in
space at a particular time. The flow of the fluid
is said to be steady if at any given point, the
velocity of each passing fluid particle remains
constant in time. This does not mean that the
velocity at different points in space is same. The
velocity of a particular particle may change as it
moves from one point to another. That is, at some
other point the particle may have a different
velocity, but every other particle which passes
the second point behaves exactly as the previous
particle that has just passed that point. Each
particle follows a smooth path, and the paths of
the particles do not cross each other.

= 1470 N
≈ 1.5 × 103 N
The air pressure that will produce this
force is

This is almost double the atmospheric
pressure.
⊳
Hydraulic brakes in automobiles also work on
the same principle. When we apply a little force
on the pedal with our foot the master piston
moves inside the master cylinder, and the
pressure caused is transmitted through the
brake oil to act on a piston of larger area. A large
force acts on the piston and is pushed down
expanding the brake shoes against brake lining.
In this way, a small force on the pedal produces
a large retarding force on the wheel. An

The meaning of streamlines. (a) A typical
trajectory of a fluid particle.
(b) A region of streamline flow.

The path taken by a fluid particle under a
steady flow is a streamline. It is defined as a
curve whose tangent at any point is in the
direction of the fluid velocity at that point.
Consider the path of a particle as shown in
Fig.9.7 (a), the curve describes how a fluid
particle moves with time. The curve PQ is like a



MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS

187

permanent map of fluid flow, indicating how the
fluid streams. No two streamlines can cross, for
if they do, an oncoming fluid particle can go
either one way or the other and the flow would
not be steady. Hence, in steady flow, the map of
flow is stationary in time. How do we draw closely
spaced streamlines ? If we intend to show
streamline of every flowing particle, we would
end up with a continuum of lines. Consider planes
perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow e.g.,
at three points P, R and Q in Fig.9.7 (b). The plane
pieces are so chosen that their boundaries be
determined by the same set of streamlines. This
means that number of fluid particles crossing
the surfaces as indicated at P, R and Q is the
same. If area of cross-sections at these points
are AP,AR and AQ and speeds of fluid particles
are vP, vR and vQ, then mass of fluid ∆mP crossing
at AP in a small interval of time ∆t is ρPAPvP ∆t.
Similarly mass of fluid ∆mR flowing or crossing
at AR in a small interval of time ∆t is ρRARvR ∆t
and mass of fluid ∆mQ is ρQAQvQ ∆t crossing at
AQ. The mass of liquid flowing out equals the
mass flowing in, holds in all cases. Therefore,
ρPAPvP∆t = ρRARvR∆t = ρQAQvQ∆t
(9.9)
For flow of incompressible fluids
ρP = ρR = ρQ
Equation (9.9) reduces to
APvP = ARvR = AQvQ
(9.10)
which is called the equation of continuity and
it is a statement of conservation of mass in flow
of incompressible fluids. In general
Av = constant
(9.11)
Av gives the volume flux or flow rate and
remains constant throughout the pipe of flow.
Thus, at narrower portions where the
streamlines are closely spaced, velocity
increases and its vice versa. From (Fig 9.7b) it
is clear that AR > AQ or vR < vQ, the fluid is
accelerated while passing from R to Q. This is
associated with a change in pressure in fluid
flow in horizontal pipes.
Steady flow is achieved at low flow speeds.
Beyond a limiting value, called critical speed,
this flow loses steadiness and becomes
turbulent. One sees this when a fast flowing
stream encounters rocks, small foamy
whirlpool-like regions called ‘white water
rapids are formed.
Figure 9.8 displays streamlines for some
typical flows. For example, Fig. 9.8(a) describes
a laminar flow where the velocities at different
points in the fluid may have different magnitudes

but their directions are parallel. Figure 9.8 (b)
gives a sketch of turbulent flow.

(b) A jet of air striking a flat plate placed
perpendicular to it. This is an example

9.4 BERNOULLI’S PRINCIPLE
Fluid flow is a complex phenomenon. But we
can obtain some useful properties for steady
or streamline flows using the conservation
of energy.
Consider a fluid moving in a pipe of varying
cross-sectional area. Let the pipe be at varying
heights as shown in Fig. 9.9. We now suppose
that an incompressible fluid is flowing through
the pipe in a steady flow. Its velocity must
change as a consequence of equation of
continuity. A force is required to produce this
acceleration, which is caused by the fluid
surrounding it, the pressure must be different
in different regions. Bernoulli’s equation is a
general expression that relates the pressure
difference between two points in a pipe to both
velocity changes (kinetic energy change) and
elevation (height) changes (potential energy
change). The Swiss Physicist Daniel Bernoulli
developed this relationship in 1738.
Consider the flow at two regions 1 (i.e., BC)
and 2 (i.e., DE). Consider the fluid initially lying
between B and D. In an infinitesimal time
interval ∆t, this fluid would have moved. Suppose
v1 is the speed at B and v2 at D, then fluid initially
at B has moved a distance v1∆t to C (v1∆t is small
enough to assume constant cross-section along
BC). In the same interval ∆t the fluid initially at
D moves to E, a distance equal to v2∆t. Pressures
P1 and P2 act as shown on the plane faces of
areas A1 and A2 binding the two regions. The
work done on the fluid at left end (BC) is W1 =
P1A1(v1∆t) = P1∆V. Since the same volume ∆V
passes through both the regions (from the
equation of continuity) the work done by the fluid
at the other end (DE) is W2 = P2A2(v2∆t) = P2∆V or,



188

PHYSICS

the work done on the fluid is –P2∆V. So the total
work done on the fluid is
W1 – W2 = (P1− P2) ∆V
Part of this work goes into changing the kinetic
energy of the fluid, and part goes into changing
the gravitational potential energy. If the density
of the fluid is ρ and ∆m = ρA1v1∆t = ρ∆V is the
mass passing through the pipe in time ∆t, then
change in gravitational potential energy is
∆U = ρg∆V (h2 − h1)
The change in its kinetic energy is
∆K =

1
ρ ∆V (v22 − v12)
2

We can employ the work – energy theorem
(Chapter 6) to this volume of the fluid and
this yields
(P1− P2) ∆V =

1
ρ ∆V (v22 − v12) + ρg∆V (h2 − h1)
2

We now divide each term by ∆V to obtain

1
ρ (v22 − v12) + ρg (h2 − h1)
2
We can rearrange the above terms to obtain
(P1− P2) =

P1 +

1
ρv12 + ρgh1 = P2+
2

1
ρv22 + ρgh2
2

(9.12)
This is Bernoulli’s equation. Since 1 and 2
refer to any two locations along the pipeline, we
may write the expression in general as
P+

1
ρv2 + ρgh = constant
2

In words, the Bernoulli’s relation may be
stated as follows: As we move along a streamline
the sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy
 ρv 2 
per unit volume  2  and the potential energy



per unit volume (ρgh) remains a constant.
Note that in applying the energy conservation
principle, there is an assumption that no energy
is lost due to friction. But in fact, when fluids
flow, some energy does get lost due to internal
friction. This arises due to the fact that in a fluid
flow, the different layers of the fluid flow with
different velocities. These layers exert frictional
forces on each other resulting in a loss of energy.
This property of the fluid is called viscosity and
is discussed in more detail in a later section. The
lost kinetic energy of the fluid gets converted into
heat energy. Thus, Bernoulli’s equation ideally
applies to fluids with zero viscosity or nonviscous fluids. Another restriction on application
of Bernoulli theorem is that the fluids must be
incompressible, as the elastic energy of the fluid
is also not taken into consideration. In practice,
it has a large number of useful applications and
can help explain a wide variety of phenomena
for low viscosity incompressible fluids.
Bernoulli’s equation also does not hold for nonsteady or turbulent flows, because in that
situation velocity and pressure are constantly
fluctuating in time.
When a fluid is at rest i.e., its velocity is zero
everywhere, Bernoulli’s equation becomes

(9.13)

P1 + ρgh1 = P2 + ρgh2
(P1− P2) = ρg (h2 − h1)
which is same as Eq. (9.6).

v1∆t moves to the section of length v2∆t in

The word efflux means fluid outflow. Torricelli
discovered that the speed of efflux from an open
tank is given by a formula identical to that of a
freely falling body. Consider a tank containing
a liquid of density ρ with a small hole in its side
at a height y1 from the bottom (see Fig. 9.10).
The air above the liquid, whose surface is at
height y2, is at pressure P. From the equation of
continuity [Eq. (9.10)] we have

Torricelli’s law. The speed of efflux, v1,
from the side of the container is given by
the application of Bernoulli’s equation.
If the container is open at the top to the
atmosphere then v1 = 2 g h .

If the cross-sectional area of the tank A2 is
much larger than that of the hole (A2 >>A1), then
we may take the fluid to be approximately at rest
at the top, i.e., v2 = 0. Now, applying the Bernoulli
equation at points 1 and 2 and noting that at
the hole P1 = Pa, the atmospheric pressure, we
have from Eq. (9.12)

ρ v12 + ρ g y1 = P + ρ g y2

Taking y2 – y1 = h we have
Pa +

v1 = 2 g h +

When P >>Pa and 2 g h may be ignored, the
speed of efflux is determined by the container
pressure. Such a situation occurs in rocket
propulsion. On the other hand, if the tank is
open to the atmosphere, then P = Pa and
v1 = 2g h

This is also the speed of a freely falling body.

Dynamic lift is the force that acts on a body,
such as airplane wing, a hydrofoil or a spinning
ball, by virtue of its motion through a fluid. In
many games such as cricket, tennis, baseball,
or golf, we notice that a spinning ball deviates

from its parabolic trajectory as it moves through
air. This deviation can be partly explained on
the basis of Bernoulli’s principle.
(i) Ball moving without spin: Fig. 9.11(a)
shows the streamlines around a
non-spinning ball moving relative to a
fluid. From the symmetry of streamlines
it is clear that the velocity of fluid (air)
above and below the ball at corresponding
points is the same resulting in zero
pressure difference. The air therefore,
exerts no upward or downward force on
the ball.
(ii) Ball moving with spin: A ball which is
spinning drags air along with it. If the
surface is rough more air will be dragged.
Fig 9.11(b) shows the streamlines of air
for a ball which is moving and spinning
at the same time. The ball is moving
forward and relative to it the air is moving
backwards. Therefore, the velocity of air
above the ball relative to the ball is larger
and below it is smaller (see Section 9.3).
The stream lines, thus, get crowded above
and rarified below.
This difference in the velocities of air results
in the pressure difference between the lower and
upper faces and there is a net upward force on
the ball. This dynamic lift due to spining is called
Magnus effect.
Aerofoil or lift on aircraft wing: Figure 9.11
(c) shows an aerofoil, which is a solid piece
shaped to provide an upward dynamic lift
when it moves horizontally through air. The
cross-section of the wings of an aeroplane
looks somewhat like the aerofoil shown in Fig.
9.11 (c) with streamlines around it. When the
aerofoil moves against the wind, the
orientation of the wing relative to flow direction
causes the streamlines to crowd together
above the wing more than those below it. The
flow speed on top is higher than that below it.
There is an upward force resulting in a
dynamic lift of the wings and this balances
the weight of the plane. The following example
illustrates this.

Answer (a) The weight of the Boeing aircraft is
balanced by the upward force due to the
pressure difference

∆P = (3.3 × 105 kg × 9.8 m s–2) / 500 m2

9.5 VISCOSITY
Most of the fluids are not ideal ones and offer some
resistance to motion. This resistance to fluid motion
is like an internal friction analogous to friction when
a solid moves on a surface. It is called viscosity.
This force exists when there is relative motion
between layers of the liquid. Suppose we consider
a fluid like oil enclosed between two glass plates
as shown in Fig. 9.12 (a). The bottom plate is fixed
while the top plate is moved with a constant
velocity v relative to the fixed plate. If oil is
replaced by honey, a greater force is required to
move the plate with the same velocity. Hence
we say that honey is more viscous than oil. The
fluid in contact with a surface has the same
velocity as that of the surfaces. Hence, the layer
of the liquid in contact with top surface moves
with a velocity v and the layer of the liquid in
contact with the fixed surface is stationary. The
velocities of layers increase uniformly from
bottom (zero velocity) to the top layer (velocity
v). For any layer of liquid, its upper layer pulls
it forward while lower layer pulls it backward.
This results in force between the layers. This



MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF FLUIDS

191

type of flow is known as laminar. The layers of
liquid slide over one another as the pages of a
book do when it is placed flat on a table and a
horizontal force is applied to the top cover. When
a fluid is flowing in a pipe or a tube, then velocity
of the liquid layer along the axis of the tube is
maximum and decreases gradually as we move
towards the walls where it becomes zero,

in a tube is constant.

change of strain’ or ‘strain rate’ i.e. ∆x/(l ∆t) or
v/l instead of strain itself. The coefficient of
viscosity (pronounced ‘eta’) for a fluid is defined
as the ratio of shearing stress to the strain rate.
(9.16)
The SI unit of viscosity is poiseiulle (Pl). Its
other units are N s m-2 or Pa s. The dimensions
of viscosity are [ML-1T-1]. Generally, thin liquids,
like water, alcohol, etc., are less viscous than
thick liquids, like coal tar, blood, glycerine, etc.
The coefficients of viscosity for some common
fluids are listed in Table 9.2. We point out two
facts about blood and water that you may find
interesting. As Table 9.2 indicates, blood is
‘thicker’ (more viscous) than water. Further, the
relative viscosity (η/ηwater) of blood remains
constant between 0 oC and 37 oC.

On account of this motion, a portion of liquid,
which at some instant has the shape ABCD,
take the shape of AEFD after short interval of
time (∆t). During this time interval the liquid has
undergone a shear strain of ∆x/l. Since, the
strain in a flowing fluid increases with time
continuously. Unlike a solid, here the stress is
found experimentally to depend on ‘rate of

temperature, while it increases in the case of gases.

Example 9.8 A metal block of area 0.10 m2 is
connected to a 0.010 kg mass via a string
that passes over an ideal pulley (considered
massless and frictionless), as in Fig. 9.13.

is placed between the block and the table.
When released the block moves to the right
with a constant speed of 0.085 m s-1. Find
the coefficient of viscosity of the liquid.



192

PHYSICS

Answer The metal block moves to the right
because of the tension in the string. The tension
T is equal in magnitude to the weight of the
suspended mass m. Thus, the shear force F is
F = T = mg = 0.010 kg × 9.8 m s–2 = 9.8 × 10-2 N
Shear stress on the fluid = F/A =

This is known as Stokes’ law. We shall not
derive Stokes’ law.
This law is an interesting example of retarding
force, which is proportional to velocity. We can
study its consequences on an object falling
through a viscous medium. We consider a
raindrop in air. It accelerates initially due to
gravity. As the velocity increases, the retarding
force also increases. Finally, when viscous force
plus buoyant force becomes equal to the force
due to gravity, the net force becomes zero and so
does the acceleration. The sphere (raindrop) then
descends with a constant velocity. Thus, in
equilibrium, this terminal velocity vt is given by
6πηavt = (4π/3) a3 (ρ-σ)g

Example 9.9 The terminal velocity of a
copper ball of radius 2.0 mm falling through
a tank of oil at 20oC is 6.5 cm s-1. Compute
the viscosity of the oil at 20oC. Density of
oil is 1.5 ×103 kg m-3, density of copper is
8.9 × 103 kg m-3.

9.5.1 Stokes’ Law
When a body falls through a fluid it drags the
layer of the fluid in contact with it. A relative
motion between the different layers of the fluid
is set and, as a result, the body experiences a
retarding force. Falling of a raindrop and
swinging of a pendulum bob are some common
examples of such motion. It is seen that the
viscous force is proportional to the velocity of
the object and is opposite to the direction of
motion. The other quantities on which the force
F depends are viscosity η of the fluid and radius
a of the sphere. Sir George G. Stokes (1819–
1903), an English scientist enunciated clearly
the viscous drag force F as
F = 6 π η av

(9.17)

(9.18)

So the terminal velocity vt depends on the
square of the radius of the sphere and inversely
on the viscosity of the medium.

Sap and water rise up to the top of the leaves of
the tree, hair of a paint brush do not cling
together when dry and even when dipped in
water but form a fine tip when taken out of it.
All these and many more such experiences are
related with the free surfaces of liquids. As
liquids have no definite shape but have a
definite volume, they acquire a free surface when
poured in a container. These surfaces possess
some additional energy. This phenomenon is
known as surface tension and it is concerned
with only liquid as gases do not have free
surfaces. Let us now understand this
phenomena.
9.6.1 Surface Energy
A liquid stays together because of attraction
between molecules. Consider a molecule well
inside a liquid. The intermolecular distances are
such that it is attracted to all the surrounding
molecules [Fig. 9.14(a)]. This attraction results
in a negative potential energy for the molecule,
which depends on the number and distribution
of molecules around the chosen one. But the
average potential energy of all the molecules is
the same. This is supported by the fact that to
take a collection of such molecules (the liquid)
and to disperse them far away from each other
in order to evaporate or vaporise, the heat of
evaporation required is quite large. For water it
is of the order of 40 kJ/mol.

Fig. 9.14

Let us consider a molecule near the surface
Fig. 9.14(b). Only lower half side of it is
surrounded by liquid molecules. There is some
negative potential energy due to these, but
obviously it is less than that of a molecule in
bulk, i.e., the one fully inside. Approximately
it is half of the latter. Thus, molecules on a
liquid surface have some extra energy in
comparison to molecules in the interior. A
liquid, thus, tends to have the least surface
area which external conditions permit.
Increasing surface area requires energy. Most
surface phenomenon can be understood in
terms of this fact. What is the energy required
for having a molecule at the surface? As
mentioned above, roughly it is half the energy
required to remove it entirely from the liquid
i.e., half the heat of evaporation.
Finally, what is a surface? Since a liquid
consists of molecules moving about, there cannot
be a perfectly sharp surface. The density of the
liquid molecules drops rapidly to zero around
z = 0 as we move along the direction indicated
Fig 9.14 (c) in a distance of the order of a few
molecular sizes.
9.6.2 Surface Energy and Surface Tension
As we have discussed that an extra energy is
associated with surface of liquids, the creation
of more surface (spreading of surface) keeping
other things like volume fixed requires a

horizontal liquid film ending in bar free to slide
over parallel guides Fig (9.15).

Fig. 9.15 Stretching a film. (a) A film in equilibrium;
(b) The film stretched an extra distance.

Suppose that we move the bar by a small
distance d as shown. Since the area of the
surface increases, the system now has more
energy, this means that some work has been
done against an internal force. Let this internal
force be F, the work done by the applied force is
F.d = Fd. From conservation of energy, this is
stored as additional energy in the film. If the
surface energy of the film is S per unit area, the
extra area is 2dl. A film has two sides and the
liquid in between, so there are two surfaces and
the extra energy is
S (2dl) = Fd

(9.19)

Or, S=Fd/2dl = F/2l

(9.20)

This quantity S is the magnitude of surface
tension. It is equal to the surface energy per unit
area of the liquid interface and is also equal to
the force per unit length exerted by the fluid on
the movable bar.
So far we have talked about the surface of
one liquid. More generally, we need to consider
fluid surface in contact with other fluids or solid
surfaces. The surface energy in that case
depends on the materials on both sides of the
surface. For example, if the molecules of the
materials attract each other, surface energy is
reduced while if they repel each other the
surface energy is increased. Thus, more
appropriately, the surface energy is the energy
of the interface between two materials and
depends on both of them.

We make the following observations from
above:
(i) Surface tension is a force per unit length
(or surface energy per unit area) acting in
the plane of the interface between the plane
of the liquid and any other substance; it also
is the extra energy that the molecules at the
interface have as compared to molecules in
the interior.
(ii) At any point on the interface besides the
boundary, we can draw a line and imagine
equal and opposite surface tension forces
S per unit length of the line acting
perpendicular to the line, in the plane of
the interface. The line is in equilibrium. To
be more specific, imagine a line of atoms or
molecules at the surface. The atoms to the
left pull the line towards them; those to the
right pull it towards them! This line of
atoms is in equilibrium under tension. If
the line really marks the end of the
interface, as in Figure 9.14 (a) and (b) there
is only the force S per unit length
acting inwards.
Table 9.3 gives the surface tension of various
liquids. The value of surface tension depends
on temperature. Like viscosity, the surface
tension of a liquid usually falls with
temperature.

A fluid will stick to a solid surface if the
surface energy between fluid and the solid is
smaller than the sum of surface energies
between solid-air, and fluid-air. Now there is
attraction between the solid surface and the
liquid. It can be directly measured
experimentaly as schematically shown in Fig.
9.16. A flat vertical glass plate, below which a
vessel of some liquid is kept, forms one arm of
the balance. The plate is balanced by weights
on the other side, with its horizontal edge just
over water. The vessel is raised slightly till the
liquid just touches the glass plate and pulls it
down a little because of surface tension. Weights
are added till the plate just clears water.

by θ. It is different at interfaces of different pairs
of liquids and solids. The value of θ determines
whether a liquid will spread on the surface of a
solid or it will form droplets on it. For example,
water forms droplets on lotus leaf as shown in
Fig. 9.17 (a) while spreads over a clean plastic
plate as shown in Fig. 9.17(b).

(a)

(b)
Fig. 9.17

Fig. 9.16 Measuring Surface Tension.

Suppose the additional weight required is W.
Then from Eq. 9.20 and the discussion given
there, the surface tension of the liquid-air
interface is
Sla = (W/2l) = (mg/2l )

(9.21)

where m is the extra mass and l is the length of
the plate edge. The subscript (la) emphasises
the fact that the liquid-air interface tension
is involved.
9.6.3 Angle of Contact
The surface of liquid near the plane of contact,
with another medium is in general curved. The
angle between tangent to the liquid surface at
the point of contact and solid surface inside the
liquid is termed as angle of contact. It is denoted

Different shapes of water drops with
interfacial tensions (a) on a lotus leaf (b)
on a clean plastic plate.

We consider the three interfacial tensions at
all the three interfaces, liquid-air, solid-air and
solid-liquid denoted by Sla, Ssa and Ssl , respectively
as given in Fig. 9.17 (a) and (b). At the line of
contact, the surface forces between the three media
must be in equilibrium. From the Fig. 9.17(b) the
following relation is easily derived.
Sla cos θ + Ssl = Ssa

(9.22)

The angle of contact is an obtuse angle if
Ssl > Sla as in the case of water-leaf interface
while it is an acute angle if Ssl < Sla as in the
case of water-plastic interface. When θ is an
obtuse angle then molecules of liquids are
attracted strongly to themselves and weakly to
those of solid, it costs a lot of energy to create a
liquid-solid surface, and liquid then does not
wet the solid. This is what happens with water
on a waxy or oily surface, and with mercury on



196

PHYSICS

any surface. On the other hand, if the molecules
of the liquid are strongly attracted to those of
the solid, this will reduce Ssl and therefore,
cos θ may increase or θ may decrease. In this
case θ is an acute angle. This is what happens
for water on glass or on plastic and for kerosene
oil on virtually anything (it just spreads). Soaps,
detergents and dying substances are wetting
agents. When they are added the angle of
contact becomes small so that these may
penetrate well and become effective. Water
proofing agents on the other hand are added to
create a large angle of contact between the water
and fibres.

so that
(Pi – Po) = (2 Sla/ r)

In general, for a liquid-gas interface, the
convex side has a higher pressure than the
concave side. For example, an air bubble in a
liquid, would have higher pressure inside it.
See Fig 9.18 (b).

Fig. 9.18 Drop, cavity and bubble of radius r.

9.6.4 Drops and Bubbles
One consequence of surface tension is that free
liquid drops and bubbles are spherical if effects
of gravity can be neglected. You must have seen
this especially clearly in small drops just formed
in a high-speed spray or jet, and in soap bubbles
blown by most of us in childhood. Why are drops
and bubbles spherical? What keeps soap
bubbles stable?
As we have been saying repeatedly, a liquidair interface has energy, so for a given volume
the surface with minimum energy is the one with
the least area. The sphere has this property.
Though it is out of the scope of this book, but
you can check that a sphere is better than at
least a cube in this respect! So, if gravity and
other forces (e.g. air resistance) were ineffective,
liquid drops would be spherical.
Another interesting consequence of surface
tension is that the pressure inside a spherical
drop Fig. 9.18(a) is more than the pressure
outside. Suppose a spherical drop of radius r is
in equilibrium. If its radius increase by ∆r. The
extra surface energy is
[4π(r + ∆r) 2- 4πr2] Sla = 8πr ∆r Sla

W = (Pi – Po) 4πr ∆r

A bubble Fig 9.18 (c) differs from a drop
and a cavity; in this it has two interfaces. Applying
the above argument we have for a bubble
(Pi – Po) = (4 Sla/ r)

(9.26)

This is probably why you have to blow hard,
but not too hard, to form a soap bubble. A little
extra air pressure is needed inside!
9.6.5 Capillary Rise
One consequence of the pressure difference
across a curved liquid-air interface is the wellknown effect that water rises up in a narrow
tube in spite of gravity. The word capilla means
hair in Latin; if the tube were hair thin, the rise
would be very large. To see this, consider a
vertical capillary tube of circular cross section
(radius a) inserted into an open vessel of water
(Fig. 9.19). The contact angle between water and

(9.23)

If the drop is in equilibrium this energy cost is
balanced by the energy gain due to
expansion under the pressure difference (Pi – Po)
between the inside of the bubble and the outside.
The work done is

(Pi – Po) =(2S/r) = 2S/(a sec θ )
= (2S/a) cos θ

(9.27)

Thus the pressure of the water inside the
tube, just at the meniscus (air-water interface)
is less than the atmospheric pressure. Consider
the two points A and B in Fig. 9.19(a). They
must be at the same pressure, namely
P0 + h ρ g = Pi = PA
(9.28)
where ρ is the density of water and h is called
the capillary rise [Fig. 9.19(a)]. Using
Eq. (9.27) and (9.28) we have
h ρ g = (Pi – P0) = (2S cos θ )/a

(9.29)

The discussion here, and the Eqs. (9.24) and
(9.25) make it clear that the capillary rise is due
to surface tension. It is larger, for a smaller a.
Typically it is of the order of a few cm for fine
capillaries. For example, if a = 0.05 cm, using
the value of surface tension for water (Table 9.3),
we find that
h = 2S/(ρ g a)
=

2 ×(0.073 N m-1 )
(10 kg m-3 ) (9.8 m s-2 )(5 × 10-4 m)
3

= 2.98 × 10–2 m = 2.98 cm
Notice that if the liquid meniscus is convex,
as for mercury, i.e., if cos θ is negative then from
Eq. (9.28) for example, it is clear that the liquid
will be lower in the capillary !

⊳

glass is acute. Thus the surface of water in the
capillary is concave. This means that there is
a pressure difference between the two sides
of the top surface. This is given by

Example 9.10 The lower end of a capillary
tube of diameter 2.00 mm is dipped 8.00
cm below the surface of water in a beaker.
What is the pressure required in the tube
in order to blow a hemispherical bubble at
its end in water? The surface tension of
water at temperature of the experiments is
7.30 × 10-2 Nm-1. 1 atmospheric pressure =
1.01 × 105 Pa, density of water = 1000 kg/m3,
g = 9.80 m s-2. Also calculate the excess
pressure.

Answer The excess pressure in a bubble of gas
in a liquid is given by 2S/r, where S is the
surface tension of the liquid-gas interface. You
should note there is only one liquid surface in
this case. (For a bubble of liquid in a gas, there
are two liquid surfaces, so the formula for
excess pressure in that case is 4S/r.) The
radius of the bubble is r. Now the pressure
outside the bubble Po equals atmospheric
pressure plus the pressure due to 8.00 cm of
water column. That is
Po = (1.01 × 105 Pa + 0.08 m × 1000 kg m–3
× 9.80 m s–2)
5
= 1.01784 × 10 Pa
Therefore, the pressure inside the bubble is
Pi = Po + 2S/r
= 1.01784 × 105 Pa + (2 × 7.3 × 10-2 Pa m/10-3 m)
= (1.01784 + 0.00146) × 105 Pa
= 1.02 × 105 Pa
where the radius of the bubble is taken
to be equal to the radius of the capillary tube,
since the bubble is hemispherical ! (The answer
has been rounded off to three significant figures.)
The excess pressure in the bubble is 146 Pa.

SUMMARY
1.

The basic property of a fluid is that it can flow. The fluid does not have any
resistance to change of its shape. Thus, the shape of a fluid is governed by the
shape of its container.

2.

A liquid is incompressible and has a free surface of its own. A gas is compressible
and it expands to occupy all the space available to it.

3.

If F is the normal force exerted by a fluid on an area A then the average pressure Pav
is defined as the ratio of the force to area

Pav =

F
A



198

PHYSICS

4.

The unit of the pressure is the pascal (Pa). It is the same as N m-2. Other common
units of pressure are
1 atm = 1.01×105 Pa
1 bar = 105 Pa
1 torr = 133 Pa = 0.133 kPa
1 mm of Hg = 1 torr = 133 Pa

5.

Pascal’s law states that: Pressure in a fluid at rest is same at all points which are at
the same height. A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted
undiminished to every point of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel.

6.

The pressure in a fluid varies with depth h according to the expression
P = Pa + ρgh
where ρ is the density of the fluid, assumed uniform.

7.

The volume of an incompressible fluid passing any point every second in a pipe of
non uniform crossection is the same in the steady flow.
v A = constant ( v is the velocity and A is the area of crossection)
The equation is due to mass conservation in incompressible fluid flow.

8.

Bernoulli’s principle states that as we move along a streamline, the sum of the
pressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume (ρv2/2) and the potential energy per
unit volume (ρgy) remains a constant.
P + ρv2/2 + ρgy = constant
The equation is basically the conservation of energy applied to non viscuss fluid
motion in steady state. There is no fluid which have zero viscosity, so the above
statement is true only approximately. The viscosity is like friction and converts the
kinetic energy to heat energy.

9.

Though shear strain in a fluid does not require shear stress, when a shear stress is
applied to a fluid, the motion is generated which causes a shear strain growing
with time. The ratio of the shear stress to the time rate of shearing strain is known
as coefficient of viscosity, η.

Stokes’ law states that the viscous drag force F on a sphere of radius a moving with

Surface tension is a force per unit length (or surface energy per unit area) acting in
the plane of interface between the liquid and the bounding surface. It is the extra
energy that the molecules at the interface have as compared to the interior.

Pressure is a scalar quantity. The definition of the pressure as “force per unit area”
may give one false impression that pressure is a vector. The “force” in the numerator of
the definition is the component of the force normal to the area upon which it is
impressed. While describing fluids as a concept, shift from particle and rigid body
mechanics is required. We are concerned with properties that vary from point to point
in the fluid.
One should not think of pressure of a fluid as being exerted only on a solid like the
walls of a container or a piece of solid matter immersed in the fluid. Pressure exists at
all points in a fluid. An element of a fluid (such as the one shown in Fig. 9.4) is in
equilibrium because the pressures exerted on the various faces are equal.

The expression for pressure
P = Pa + ρgh
holds true if fluid is incompressible. Practically speaking it holds for liquids, which
are largely incompressible and hence is a constant with height.
The gauge pressure is the difference of the actual pressure and the atmospheric pressure.
P – Pa = Pg
Many pressure-measuring devices measure the gauge pressure. These include the tyre
pressure gauge and the blood pressure gauge (sphygmomanometer).
A streamline is a map of fluid flow. In a steady flow two streamlines do not intersect as
it means that the fluid particle will have two possible velocities at the point.
Bernoulli’s principle does not hold in presence of viscous drag on the fluid. The work
done by this dissipative viscous force must be taken into account in this case, and P2
[Fig. 9.9] will be lower than the value given by Eq. (9.12).
As the temperature rises the atoms of the liquid become more mobile and the coefficient
of viscosity, η falls. In a gas the temperature rise increases the random motion of
atoms and η increases.
Surface tension arises due to excess potential energy of the molecules on the surface
in comparison to their potential energy in the interior. Such a surface energy is present
at the interface separating two substances at least one of which is a fluid. It is not the
property of a single fluid alone.

Summary

Exercises
Additional Exercises

We all have common sense notions of heat and temperature.
Temperature is a measure of ‘hotness’ of a body. A kettle
with boiling water is hotter than a box containing ice. In
physics, we need to define the notion of heat, temperature,
etc., more carefully. In this chapter, you will learn what heat
is and how it is measured, and study the various proceses by
which heat flows from one body to another. Along the way,
you will find out why blacksmiths heat the iron ring before
fitting on the rim of a wooden wheel of a horse cart and why
the wind at the beach often reverses direction after the sun
goes down. You will also learn what happens when water boils
or freezes, and its temperature does not change during these
processes even though a great deal of heat is flowing into or
out of it.
10.2 TEMPERATURE AND HEAT
We can begin studying thermal properties of matter with
definitions of temperature and heat. Temperature is a relative
measure, or indication of hotness or coldness. A hot utensil
is said to have a high temperature, and ice cube to have a
low temperature. An object that has a higher temperature
than another object is said to be hotter. Note that hot and
cold are relative terms, like tall and short. We can perceive
temperature by touch. However, this temperature sense is
somewhat unreliable and its range is too limited to be useful
for scientific purposes.
We know from experience that a glass of ice-cold water left
on a table on a hot summer day eventually warms up whereas
a cup of hot tea on the same table cools down. It means that
when the temperature of body, ice-cold water or hot tea in
this case, and its surrounding medium are different, heat
transfer takes place between the system and the surrounding
medium, until the body and the surrounding medium are at
the same temperature. We also know that in the case of glass
tumbler of ice-cold water, heat flows from the environment to



THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER

203

the glass tumbler, whereas in the case of hot
tea, it flows from the cup of hot tea to the
environment. So, we can say that heat is the
form of energy transferred between two (or
more) systems or a system and its
surroundings by virtue of temperature
difference. The SI unit of heat energy
transferred is expressed in joule (J) while SI unit
of temperature is Kelvin (K), and degree Celsius
(oC) is a commonly used unit of temperature.
When an object is heated, many changes may
take place. Its temperature may rise, it may
expand or change state. We will study the effect
of heat on different bodies in later sections.
10.3 MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE
A measure of temperature is obtained using a
thermometer. Many physical properties of
materials change sufficiently with temperature.
Some such properties are used as the basis for
constructing thermometers. The commonly used
property is variation of the volume of a liquid
with temperature. For example, in common
liquid–in–glass thermometers, mercury, alcohol
etc., are used whose volume varies linearly with
temperature over a wide range.
Thermometers are calibrated so that a
numerical value may be assigned to a given
temperature in an appropriate scale. For the
definition of any standard scale, two fixed
reference points are needed. Since all
substances change dimensions with
temperature, an absolute reference for
expansion is not available. However, the
necessary fixed points may be correlated to the
physical phenomena that always occur at the
same temperature. The ice point and the steam
point of water are two convenient fixed points
and are known as the freezing and boiling
points, respectively. These two points are the
temperatures at which pure water freezes and
boils under standard pressure. The two familiar
temperature scales are the Fahrenheit
temperature scale and the Celsius temperature
scale. The ice and steam point have values
32 °F and 212 °F, respectively, on the Fahrenheit
scale and 0 °C and 100 °C on the Celsius scale.
On the Fahrenheit scale, there are 180 equal
intervals between two reference points, and on
the Celsius scale, there are 100.

Fig. 10.1 A plot of Fahrenheit temperature (tF) versus
Celsius temperature (tc ).

A relationship for converting between the two
scales may be obtained from a graph of
Fahrenheit temperature (tF ) versus celsius
temperature (tC) in a straight line (Fig. 10.1),
whose equation is

10.4 IDEAL-GAS EQUATION AND
ABSOLUTE TEMPERATURE
Liquid-in-glass thermometers show different
readings for temperatures other than the fixed
points because of differing expansion properties.
A thermometer that uses a gas, however, gives
the same readings regardless of which gas is
used. Experiments show that all gases at low
densities exhibit same expansion behaviour. The
variables that describe the behaviour of a given
quantity (mass) of gas are pressure, volume, and
temperature (P, V, and T )(where T = t + 273.15;
t is the temperature in °C). When temperature
is held constant, the pressure and volume of a
quantity of gas are related as PV = constant.
This relationship is known as Boyle’s law, after
Robert Boyle (1627–1691), the English Chemist
who discovered it. When the pressure is held
constant, the volume of a quantity of the gas is
related to the temperature as V/T = constant.
This relationship is known as Charles’ law,
after French scientist Jacques Charles (1747–
1823). Low-density gases obey these
laws, which may be combined into a single



204

PHYSICS

Fig. 10.2 Pressure versus temperature of a low
density gas kept at constant volume.

relationship. Notice that since PV = constant
and V/T = constant for a given quantity of gas,
then PV/T should also be a constant. This
relationship is known as ideal gas law. It can be
written in a more general form that applies not
just to a given quantity of a single gas but to any
quantity of any low-density gas and is known as
ideal-gas equation:

or PV = µRT
(10.2)
where, µ is the number of moles in the sample of
gas and R is called universal gas constant:
R = 8.31 J mol–1 K–1
In Eq. 10.2, we have learnt that the pressure
and volume are directly proportional to
temperature : PV ∝ T. This relationship allows a
gas to be used to measure temperature in a
constant volume gas thermometer. Holding the
volume of a gas constant, it gives P ∝T. Thus,
with a constant-volume gas thermometer,
temperature is read in terms of pressure. A plot
of pressure versus temperature gives a straight
line in this case, as shown in Fig. 10.2.
However, measurements on real gases deviate
from the values predicted by the ideal gas law
at low temperature. But the relationship is linear
over a large temperature range, and it looks as
though the pressure might reach zero with
decreasing temperature if the gas continued to
be a gas. The absolute minimum temperature
for an ideal gas, therefore, inferred by
extrapolating the straight line to the axis, as in
Fig. 10.3. This temperature is found to be
– 273.15 °C and is designated as absolute zero.
Absolute zero is the foundation of the Kelvin
temperature scale or absolute scale temperature

extrapolation of lines for low density gases

temperature.

named after the British scientist Lord Kelvin. On
this scale, – 273.15 °C is taken as the zero point,
that is 0 K (Fig. 10.4).

Fig. 10.4 Comparision of the Kelvin, Celsius and
Fahrenheit temperature scales.

The size of unit in Kelvin and Celsius
temperature scales is the same. So, temperature
on these scales are related by
T = tC + 273.15

10.5 THERMAL EXPANSION
You may have observed that sometimes sealed
bottles with metallic lids are so tightly screwed
that one has to put the lid in hot water for some
time to open it. This would allow the metallic lid
to expand, thereby loosening it to unscrew
easily. In case of liquids, you may have observed
that mercury in a thermometer rises, when the
thermometer is put in slightly warm water. If
we take out the thermometer from the warm



THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER

205

water the level of mercury falls again. Similarly,
in case of gases, a balloon partially inflated in a
cool room may expand to full size when placed
in warm water. On the other hand, a fully
inflated balloon when immersed in cold water
would start shrinking due to contraction of the
air inside.
It is our common experience that most
substances expand on heating and contract on
cooling. A change in the temperature of a body
causes change in its dimensions. The increase
in the dimensions of a body due to the increase
in its temperature is called thermal expansion.
The expansion in length is called linear
expansion. The expansion in area is called area
expansion. The expansion in volume is called
volume expansion (Fig. 10.5).

Here α V is also a characteristic of the

is seen that αV becomes constant only at a high
temperature.

If the substance is in the form of a long rod,
then for small change in temperature, ∆T, the

proportional to ∆T.

where α1 is known as the coefficient of linear
expansion (or linear expansivity) and is
characteristic of the material of the rod. In Table
10.1, typical average values of the coefficient of
linear expansion for some material in the
temperature range 0 °C to 100 °C are given. From
this Table, compare the value of αl for glass and
copper. We find that copper expands about five
times more than glass for the same rise in
temperature. Normally, metals expand more and
have relatively high values of αl.

as a function of temperature.

Table 10.2 gives the values of coefficient of
volume expansion of some common substances

that thermal expansion of these substances

alloy) having particularly low values of αV. From

expands more than mercury for the same rise

Water exhibits an anomalous behaviour; it
contracts on heating between 0 °C and 4 °C. The
volume of a given amount of water decreases as
it is cooled from room temperature, until its
temperature reaches 4 °C, [Fig. 10.7(a)]. Below
4 °C, the volume increases, and therefore, the
density decreases [Fig. 10.7(b)].
This means that water has the maximum
density at 4 °C. This property has an important
environmental effect: bodies of water, such as

Temperature (°C)
(a)
Fig. 10.7

lakes and ponds, freeze at the top first. As a lake
cools toward 4 °C, water near the surface loses
energy to the atmosphere, becomes denser, and
sinks; the warmer, less dense water near the
bottom rises. However, once the colder water on
top reaches temperature below 4 °C, it becomes
less dense and remains at the surface, where it
freezes. If water did not have this property, lakes
and ponds would freeze from the bottom up,
which would destroy much of their animal and
plant life.
Gases, at ordinary temperature, expand more
than solids and liquids. For liquids, the
coefficient of volume expansion is relatively
independent of the temperature. However, for
gases it is dependent on temperature. For an
ideal gas, the coefficient of volume expansion at
constant pressure can be found from the ideal
gas equation:

At 0 °C, αv = 3.7 × 10–3 K–1, which is much
larger than that for solids and liquids.
Equation (10.6) shows the temperature
dependence of αv; it decreases with increasing
temperature. For a gas at room temperature and
constant pressure, αv is about 3300 × 10–6 K–1, as
i.e., αv =

much as order(s) of magnitude larger than the
coefficient of volume expansion of typical liquids.
There is a simple relation between the
coefficient of volume expansion ( α v ) and
coefficient of linear expansion (αl). Imagine a
cube of length, l, that expands equally in all
directions, when its temperature increases by
∆T. We have
∆l = αl l ∆T
(10.7)
so, ∆V = (l+∆l)3 – l3 ≃ 3l2 ∆l
In Equation (10.7), terms in (∆l)2 and (∆l)3 have
been neglected since ∆l is small compared to l.

What happens by preventing the thermal
expansion of a rod by fixing its ends rigidly?
Clearly, the rod acquires a compressive strain
due to the external forces provided by the rigid
support at the ends. The corresponding stress
set up in the rod is called thermal stress. For
example, consider a steel rail of length 5 m and
area of cross-section 40 cm2 that is prevented
from expanding while the temperature rises by
10 °C. The coefficient of linear expansion of steel
is αl(steel) = 1.2 × 10–5 K–1. Thus, the compressive

∆l
strain is
= αl(steel) ∆T = 1.2 × 10–5 × 10=1.2 × 10–4.
l
Youngs modulus of steel is Y (steel) = 2 × 1011 N m–2.
Therefore, the thermal stress developed is
∆F
 ∆l 
= Y steel   = 2.4 × 10 7 N m –2 , which
A
 l 

corresponds to an external force of

 ∆l 
 = 2.4 × 107 × 40 × 10–4 j 105N. If
 l 

∆F = AYsteel 

two such steel rails, fixed at their outer ends,
are in contact at their inner ends, a force of this
magnitude can easily bend the rails.

Example 10.1 Show that the coefficient of
area expansion, (∆A/A)/∆T, of a
rectangular sheet of the solid is twice its
linear expansivity, αl.

Consider a rectangular sheet of the solid
material of length a and breadth b (Fig. 10.8 ).
When the temperature increases by ∆T, a
increases by ∆a = αl a∆T and b increases by ∆b
= αlb ∆T. From Fig. 10.8, the increase in area
∆A = ∆A1 +∆A2 + ∆A3
∆A = a ∆b + b ∆a + (∆a) (∆b)
= a αlb ∆T + b αl a ∆T + (αl)2 ab (∆T)2
= αl ab ∆T (2 + αl ∆T) = αl A ∆T (2 + αl ∆T)
Since α l ≃ 10–5 K–1, from Table 10.1, the
product αl ∆T for fractional temperature is small
in comparision with 2 and may be neglected.

10.6 SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY
Take some water in a vessel and start heating it
on a burner. Soon you will notice that bubbles
begin to move upward. As the temperature is
raised the motion of water particles increases
till it becomes turbulent as water starts boiling.
What are the factors on which the quantity of
heat required to raise the temperature of a
substance depend? In order to answer this
question in the first step, heat a given quantity
of water to raise its temperature by, say 20 °C
and note the time taken. Again take the same
amount of water and raise its temperature by
40 °C using the same source of heat. Note the
time taken by using a stopwatch. You will find it
takes about twice the time and therefore, double
the quantity of heat required raising twice the
temperature of same amount of water.
In the second step, now suppose you take
double the amount of water and heat it, using
the same heating arrangement, to raise the
temperature by 20 °C, you will find the time taken
is again twice that required in the first step.
In the third step, in place of water, now heat
the same quantity of some oil, say mustard oil,
and raise the temperature again by 20 °C. Now
note the time by the same stopwatch. You will
find the time taken will be shorter and therefore,
the quantity of heat required would be less than
that required by the same amount of water for
the same rise in temperature.
The above observations show that the quantity
of heat required to warm a given substance
depends on its mass, m, the change in
temperature, ∆T and the nature of substance.
The change in temperature of a substance, when
a given quantity of heat is absorbed or rejected
by it, is characterised by a quantity called the
heat capacity of that substance. We define heat
capacity, S of a substance as

∆Q
(10.10)
∆T
where ∆Q is the amount of heat supplied to
the substance to change its temperature from T
to T + ∆T.
You have observed that if equal amount of
heat is added to equal masses of different
substances, the resulting temperature changes
will not be the same. It implies that every
substance has a unique value for the amount of
S=

heat absorbed or given off to change the
temperature of unit mass of it by one unit. This
quantity is referred to as the specific heat
capacity of the substance.
If ∆Q stands for the amount of heat absorbed
or given off by a substance of mass m when it
undergoes a temperature change ∆T, then the
specific heat capacity, of that substance is given
by

S 1 ∆Q
=
(10.11)
m m ∆T
The specific heat capacity is the property of
the substance which determines the change in
the temperature of the substance (undergoing
no phase change) when a given quantity of heat
is absorbed (or given off) by it. It is defined as the
amount of heat per unit mass absorbed or given
off by the substance to change its temperature
by one unit. It depends on the nature of the
substance and its temperature. The SI unit of
specific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.
If the amount of substance is specified in
terms of moles µ, instead of mass m in kg, we
can define heat capacity per mole of the
substance by
s=

(10.12)
where C is known as molar specific heat
capacity of the substance. Like S, C also
depends on the nature of the substance and its
temperature. The SI unit of molar specific heat
capacity is J mol–1 K–1.
However, in connection with specific heat
capacity of gases, additional conditions may be
needed to define C. In this case, heat transfer
can be achieved by keeping either pressure or
volume constant. If the gas is held under
constant pressure during the heat transfer, then
it is called the molar specific heat capacity at
constant pressure and is denoted by Cp. On
the other hand, if the volume of the gas is
maintained during the heat transfer, then the
corresponding molar specific heat capacity is
called molar specific heat capacity at constant
volume and is denoted by Cv. For details see
Chapter 11. Table 10.3 lists measured specific
heat capacity of some substances at atmospheric
pressure and ordinary temperature while Table
10.4 lists molar specific heat capacities of some
gases. From Table 10.3 you can note that water

used as a coolant in automobile radiators, as
well as, a heater in hot water bags. Owing to its
high specific heat capacity, water warms up
more slowly than land during summer, and
consequently wind from the sea has a cooling
effect. Now, you can tell why in desert areas,
the earth surface warms up quickly during the
day and cools quickly at night.

equal to the heat gained by the colder body,
provided no heat is allowed to escape to the
surroundings. A device in which heat
measurement can be done is called a
calorimeter. It consists of a metallic vessel and
stirrer of the same material, like copper or
aluminium. The vessel is kept inside a wooden
jacket, which contains heat insulating material,
like glass wool etc. The outer jacket acts as a
heat shield and reduces the heat loss from the
inner vessel. There is an opening in the outer
jacket through which a mercury thermometer
can be inserted into the calorimeter (Fig. 10.20).
The following example provides a method by
which the specific heat capacity of a given solid
can be determinated by using the principle, heat
gained is equal to the heat lost.

10.7 CALORIMETRY
A system is said to be isolated if no exchange or
transfer of heat occurs between the system and
its surroundings. When different parts of an
isolated system are at different temperature, a
quantity of heat transfers from the part at higher
temperature to the part at lower temperature.
The heat lost by the part at higher temperature
is equal to the heat gained by the part at lower
temperature.
Calorimetry means measurement of heat.
When a body at higher temperature is brought
in contact with another body at lower
temperature, the heat lost by the hot body is

Example 10.3 A sphere of 0.047 kg
aluminium is placed for sufficient time in a
vessel containing boiling water, so that the
sphere is at 100 °C. It is then immediately
transfered to 0.14 kg copper calorimeter
containing 0.25 kg water at 20 °C. The
temperature of water rises and attains a
steady state at 23 °C. Calculate the specific
heat capacity of aluminium.

Answer In solving this example, we shall use
the fact that at a steady state, heat given by an
aluminium sphere will be equal to the heat
absorbed by the water and calorimeter.
Mass of aluminium sphere (m1) = 0.047 kg
Initial temperature of aluminium sphere =100 °C
Final temperature = 23 °C
Change in temperature (∆T)=(100 °C-23°C)= 77 °C
Let specific heat capacity of aluminium be sAl.

PHYSICS

The amount of heat lost by the aluminium
sphere = m1s Al ∆T = 0.047kg × s Al × 77 °C
Mass of water (m2) = 0.25 kg
Mass of calorimeter (m3) = 0.14 kg
Initial temperature of water and calorimeter=20 °C

Final temperature of the mixture = 23 °C
Change in temperature (∆T2) = 23 °C – 20 °C = 3 °C
Specific heat capacity of water (sw)
= 4.18 × 103 J kg–1 K–1
Specific heat capacity of copper calorimeter
= 0.386 × 103 J kg–1 K–1
The amount of heat gained by water and
calorimeter = m2 sw ∆T2 + m3scu∆T2
= (m2sw + m3scu) (∆T2)
= (0.25 kg × 4.18 × 103 J kg–1 K–1 + 0.14 kg ×
0.386 × 103 J kg–1 K–1) (23 °C – 20 °C)
In the steady state heat lost by the aluminium
sphere = heat gained by water + heat gained by
calorimeter.
So, 0.047 kg × sAl × 77 °C
= (0.25 kg × 4.18 × 103 J kg–1 K–1+ 0.14 kg ×
0.386 × 103 J kg–1 K–1)(3 °C)
sAl = 0.911 kJ kg –1 K–1

10.8 CHANGE OF STATE
Matter normally exists in three states: solid,
liquid and gas. A transition from one of these
states to another is called a change of state. Two
common changes of states are solid to liquid
and liquid to gas (and, vice versa). These changes
can occur when the exchange of heat takes place
between the substance and its surroundings.
To study the change of state on heating or
cooling, let us perform the following activity.
Take some cubes of ice in a beaker. Note the
temperature of ice. Start heating it slowly on a
constant heat source. Note the temperature after
every minute. Continuously stir the mixture of
water and ice. Draw a graph between
temperature and time (Fig. 10.9). You will observe
no change in the temperature as long as there
is ice in the beaker. In the above process, the
temperature of the system does not change even
though heat is being continuously supplied. The
heat supplied is being utilised in changing the
state from solid (ice) to liquid (water).

Fig. 10.9 A plot of temperature versus time showing
the changes in the state of ice on heating
(not to scale).

The change of state from solid to liquid is called
melting or fusion and from liquid to solid is called
freezing. It is observed that the temperature
remains constant until the entire amount of the
solid substance melts. That is, both the solid and
the liquid states of the substance coexist in
thermal equilibrium during the change of
states from solid to liquid. The temperature at
which the solid and the liquid states of the
substance is in thermal equilibrium with each
other is called its melting point. It is
characteristic of the substance. It also depends
on pressure. The melting point of a substance
at standard atomspheric pressure is called its
normal melting point. Let us do the following
activity to understand the process of melting
of ice.
Take a slab of ice. Take a metallic wire and
fix two blocks, say 5 kg each, at its ends. Put
the wire over the slab as shown in Fig. 10.10.
You will observe that the wire passes through
the ice slab. This happens due to the fact that
just below the wire, ice melts at lower
temperature due to increase in pressure. When
the wire has passed, water above the wire freezes
again. Thus, the wire passes through the slab
and the slab does not split. This phenomenon
of refreezing is called regelation. Skating is
possible on snow due to the formation of water
under the skates. Water is formed due to the
increase of pressure and it acts as a
lubricant.

100 °C when it again becomes steady. The heat
supplied is now being utilised to change water
from liquid state to vapour or gaseous state.

Fig. 10.10

After the whole of ice gets converted into water
and as we continue further heating, we shall see
that temperature begins to rise (Fig.10.9). The
temperature keeps on rising till it reaches nearly

The change of state from liquid to vapour (or
gas) is called vaporisation. It is observed that
the temperature remains constant until the
entire amount of the liquid is converted into
vapour. That is, both the liquid and vapour states
of the substance coexist in thermal equilibrium,
during the change of state from liquid to vapour.
The temperature at which the liquid and the
vapour states of the substance coexist is called
its boiling point. Let us do the following activity
to understand the process of boiling of water.
Take a round-bottom flask, more than half
filled with water. Keep it over a burner and fix a

Triple Point
The temperature of a substance remains constant during its change of state (phase change).
A graph between the temperature T and the Pressure P of the substance is called a phase
diagram or P – T diagram. The following figure shows the phase diagram of water and CO2.
Such a phase diagram divides the P – T plane into a solid-region, the vapour-region and the
liquid-region. The regions are separated by the curves such as sublimation curve (BO), fusion
curve (AO) and vaporisation curve (CO). The points on sublimation curve represent states
in which solid and vapour phases coexist. The point on the sublimation curve BO represent
states in which the solid and vapour phases co-exist. Points on the fusion curve AO represent
states in which solid and liquid phase coexist. Points on the vapourisation curve CO represent
states in which the liquid and vapour phases coexist. The temperature and pressure at which
the fusion curve, the vaporisation curve and the sublimation curve meet and all the three
phases of a substance coexist is called the triple point of the substance. For example the
triple point of water is represented by the temperature 273.16 K and pressure 6.11×10–3 Pa.

thermometer and steam outlet through the cork
of the flask (Fig. 10.11). As water gets heated in
the flask, note first that the air, which was
dissolved in the water, will come out as small
bubbles. Later, bubbles of steam will form at
the bottom but as they rise to the cooler water
near the top, they condense and disappear.
Finally, as the temperature of the entire mass
of the water reaches 100 °C, bubbles of steam
reach the surface and boiling is said to occur.
The steam in the flask may not be visible but as
it comes out of the flask, it condenses as tiny
droplets of water, giving a foggy appearance.

cork. Keep the f lask turned upside down on the
stand. Pour ice-cold water on the flask. Water
vapours in the flask condense reducing the
pressure on the water surface inside the flask.
Water begins to boil again, now at a lower
temperature. Thus boiling point decreases with
decrease in pressure.
This explains why cooking is difficult on hills.
At high altitudes, atmospheric pressure is lower,
reducing the boiling point of water as compared
to that at sea level. On the other hand, boiling
point is increased inside a pressure cooker by
increasing the pressure. Hence cooking is faster.
The boiling point of a substance at standard
atmospheric pressure is called its normal
boiling point.
However, all substances do not pass through
the three states: solid-liquid-gas. There are
certain substances which normally pass from
the solid to the vapour state directly and vice
versa. The change from solid state to vapour
state without passing through the liquid state
is called sublimation, and the substance is said
to sublime. Dry ice (solid CO2) sublimes, so also
iodine. During the sublimation process both the
solid and vapour states of a substance coexist
in thermal equilibrium.
10.8.1 Latent Heat

Fig. 10.11 Boiling process.

If now the steam outlet is closed for a few
seconds to increase the pressure in the flask,
you will notice that boiling stops. More heat
would be required to raise the temperature
(depending on the increase in pressure) before
boiling begins again. Thus boiling point increases
with increase in pressure.
Let us now remove the burner. Allow water to
cool to about 80 °C. Remove the thermometer and
steam outlet. Close the flask with the airtight

In Section 10.8, we have learnt that certain
amount of heat energy is transferred between a
substance and its surroundings when it
undergoes a change of state. The amount of heat
per unit mass transferred during change of state
of the substance is called latent heat of the
substance for the process. For example, if heat
is added to a given quantity of ice at –10 °C, the
temperature of ice increases until it reaches its
melting point (0 °C). At this temperature, the
addition of more heat does not increase the
temperature but causes the ice to melt, or
changes its state. Once the entire ice melts,
adding more heat will cause the temperature of
the water to rise. A similar situation
occurs during liquid gas change of state at the
boiling point. Adding more heat to boiling water
causes vaporisation, without increase in
temperature.

Note that when heat is added (or removed)
during a change of state, the temperature
remains constant. Note in Fig. 10.12 that the
slopes of the phase lines are not all the same,
which indicate that specific heats of the various
states are not equal. For water, the latent heat of
fusion and vaporisation are Lf = 3.33 × 105 J kg–1
and Lv = 22.6 × 105 J kg–1, respectively. That is,
3.33 × 105 J of heat is needed to melt 1 kg ice at
0 °C, and 22.6 × 105 J of heat is needed to convert
1 kg water into steam at 100 °C. So, steam at
100 °C carries 22.6 × 105 J kg–1 more heat than
water at 100 °C. This is why burns from steam
are usually more serious than those from
boiling water.
⊳

The heat required during a change of state
depends upon the heat of transformation and
the mass of the substance undergoing a change
of state. Thus, if mass m of a substance
undergoes a change from one state to the other,
then the quantity of heat required is given by
Q=mL
or L = Q/m
(10.13)
where L is known as latent heat and is a
characteristic of the substance. Its SI unit is
J kg–1. The value of L also depends on the
pressure. Its value is usually quoted at standard
atmospheric pressure. The latent heat for a solidliquid state change is called the latent heat of
fusion (Lf), and that for a liquid-gas state change
is called the latent heat of vaporisation (Lv).
These are often referred to as the heat of fusion
and the heat of vaporisation. A plot of
temperature versus heat for a quantity of water
is shown in Fig. 10.12. The latent heats of some
substances, their freezing and boiling points, are
given in Table 10.5.

10.9 HEAT TRANSFER
We have seen that heat is energy transfer
from one system to another or from one part
of a system to another part, arising due to

temperature difference. What are the different
ways by which this energy transfer takes
place? There are three distinct modes of heat
transfer: conduction, convection and radiation
(Fig. 10.13).

Fig. 10.13

Heating by conduction, convection and
radiation.

10.9.1 Conduction
Conduction is the mechanism of transfer of heat
between two adjacent parts of a body because
of their temperature difference. Suppose, one end
of a metallic rod is put in a flame, the other end
of the rod will soon be so hot that you cannot
hold it by your bare hands. Here, heat transfer
takes place by conduction from the hot end of
the rod through its different parts to the other
end. Gases are poor thermal conductors, while
liquids have conductivities intermediate between
solids and gases.
Heat conduction may be described
quantitatively as the time rate of heat flow in a
material for a given temperature difference.
Consider a metallic bar of length L and uniform
cross-section A with its two ends maintained at
different temperatures. This can be done, for
example, by putting the ends in thermal contact
with large reservoirs at temperatures, say, TC and
TD, respectively (Fig. 10.14). Let us assume the
ideal condition that the sides of the bar are fully
insulated so that no heat is exchanged between
the sides and the surroundings.
After sometime, a steady state is reached; the
temperature of the bar decreases uniformly with
distance from TC to TD; (TC>TD). The reservoir at
C supplies heat at a constant rate, which
transfers through the bar and is given out at
the same rate to the reservoir at D. It is found

prohibited and keeps the room cooler. In some
situations, heat transfer is critical. In a nuclear
reactor, for example, elaborate heat transfer
systems need to be installed so that the
enormous energy produced by nuclear fission
in the core transits out sufficiently fast, thus
preventing the core from overheating.

experimentally that in this steady state, the rate
of flow of heat (or heat current) H is proportional
to the temperature difference (TC – TD) and the
area of cross-section A and is inversely
proportional to the length L :

TC – TD
(10.14)
L
The constant of proportionality K is called the
thermal conductivity of the material. The
greater the value of K for a material, the more
rapidly will it conduct heat. The SI unit of K is
J s –1 m –1 K –1 or W m –1 K –1 . The thermal
conductivities of various substances are listed
in Table 10.6. These values vary slightly with
temperature, but can be considered to be
constant over a normal temperature range.
Compare the relatively large thermal
conductivities of good thermal conductors and,
metals, with the relatively small thermal
conductivities of some good thermal insulators,
such as wood and glass wool. You may have
noticed that some cooking pots have copper
coating on the bottom. Being a good conductor
of heat, copper promotes the distribution of heat
over the bottom of a pot for uniform cooking.
Plastic foams, on the other hand, are good
insulators, mainly because they contain pockets
of air. Recall that gases are poor conductors,
and note the low thermal conductivity of air in
the Table 10.5. Heat retention and transfer are
important in many other applications. Houses
made of concrete roofs get very hot during
summer days because thermal conductivity of
concrete (though much smaller than that of a
metal) is still not small enough. Therefore, people,
usually, prefer to give a layer of earth or foam
insulation on the ceiling so that heat transfer is

PHYSICS

Answer The insulating material around the rods
reduces heat loss from the sides of the rods.
Therefore, heat flows only along the length of
the rods. Consider any cross section of the rod.
In the steady state, heat flowing into the element
must equal the heat flowing out of it; otherwise
there would be a net gain or loss of heat by the
element and its temperature would not be
steady. Thus in the steady state, rate of heat
flowing across a cross section of the rod is the
same at every point along the length of the
combined steel-copper rod. Let T be the
temperature of the steel-copper junction in the
steady state. Then,

10.9.2 Convection
Convection is a mode of heat transfer by actual
motion of matter. It is possible only in fluids.
Convection can be natural or forced. In natural
convection, gravity plays an important part.
When a fluid is heated from below, the hot part
expands and, therefore, becomes less dense.
Because of buoyancy, it rises and the upper
colder part replaces it. This again gets heated,
rises up and is replaced by the relatively colder
part of the fluid. The process goes on. This mode
of heat transfer is evidently different from
conduction. Convection involves bulk transport
of different parts of the fluid.
In forced convection, material is forced to move
by a pump or by some other physical means. The
common examples of forced convection systems
are forced-air heating systems in home, the
human circulatory system, and the cooling
system of an automobile engine. In the human
body, the heart acts as the pump that circulates
blood through different parts of the body,
transferring heat by forced convection and
maintaining it at a uniform temperature.
Natural convection is responsible for many
familiar phenomena. During the day, the
ground heats up more quickly than large bodies

of water do. This occurs both because water has
a greater specific heat capacity and because
mixing currents disperse the absorbed heat
throughout the great volume of water. The air
in contact with the warm ground is heated by
conduction. It expands, becoming less dense
than the surrounding cooler air. As a result, the
warm air rises (air currents) and the other air
moves (winds) to fill the space-creating a sea
breeze near a large body of water. Cooler air
descends, and a thermal convection cycle is set
up, which transfers heat away from the land.
At night, the ground loses its heat more quickly,
and the water surface is warmer than the land.
As a result, the cycle is reveresed (Fig. 10.17).
The other example of natural convection is
the steady surface wind on the earth blowing
in from north-east towards the equator, the
so-called trade wind. A resonable explanation
is as follows: the equatorial and polar regions of
the earth receive unequal solar heat. Air at the
earth’s surface near the equator is hot, while
the air in the upper atmosphere of the poles is
cool. In the absence of any other factor, a
convection current would be set up, with the
air at the equatorial surface rising and moving
out towards the poles, descending and
streaming in towards the equator. The rotation
of the earth, however, modifies this convection
current. Because of this, air close to the equator
has an eastward speed of 1600 km/h, while it
is zero close to the poles. As a result, the air
descends not at the poles but at 30° N (North)
latitude and returns to the equator. This is
called trade wind.

PHYSICS

10.9.3 Radiation
Conduction and convection require some
material as a transport medium. These modes
of heat transfer cannot operate between bodies
separated by a distance in vacuum. But the
earth does receive heat from the Sun across a
huge distance. Similarly, we quickly feel the
warmth of the fire nearby even though air
conducts poorly and before convection takes
some time to set in. The third mechanism for
heat transfer needs no medium; it is called
radiation and the energy so transferred by
electromagnetic waves is called radiant energy.
In an electromagnetic wave, electric and
magnetic fields oscillate in space and time. Like
any wave, electromagnetic waves can have
different wavelengths and can travel in vacuum
with the same speed, namely the speed of light
i.e., 3 × 108 m s–1 . You will learn these matters in
more detail later, but you now know why heat
transfer by radiation does not need any medium
and why it is so fast. This is how heat is
transferred to the earth from the Sun through
empty space. All bodies emit radiant energy,
whether they are solid, liquid or gas. The
electromagnetic radiation emitted by a body by
virtue of its temperature, like radiation by a red
hot iron or light from a filament lamp is called
thermal radiation.
When this thermal radiation falls on other
bodies, it is partly reflected and partly absorbed.
The amount of heat that a body can absorb by
radiation depends on the colour of the body.
We find that black bodies absorb and emit
radiant energy better than bodies of lighter
colours. This fact finds many applications in our
daily life. We wear white or light coloured clothes
in summer, so that they absorb the least heat
from the Sun. However, during winter, we use
dark coloured clothes, which absorb heat from
the sun and keep our body warm. The bottoms of
utensils for cooking food are blackened so that
they absorb maximum heat from fire and transfer
it to the vegetables to be cooked.
Similarly, a Dewar flask or thermos bottle is
a device to minimise heat transfer between the
contents of the bottle and outside. It consists
of a double-walled glass vessel with the inner
and outer walls coated with silver. Radiation
from the inner wall is reflected back to the

contents of the bottle. The outer wall similarly
reflects back any incoming radiation. The space
between the walls is evacuted to reduce
conduction and convection losses and the flask
is supported on an insulator, like cork. The
device is, therefore, useful for preventing hot
contents (like, milk) from getting cold, or
alternatively, to store cold contents (like, ice).
10.9.4 Blackbody Radiation
We have so far not mentioned the wavelength
content of thermal radiation. The important
thing about thermal radiation at any
temperature is that it is not of one (or a few)
wavelength(s) but has a continuous spectrum
from the small to the long wavelengths. The
energy content of radiation, however, varies for
different wavelengths. Figure 10.18 gives the
experimental curves for radiation energy per unit
area per unit wavelength emitted by a blackbody
versus wavelength for different temperatures.

Fig. 10.18: Energy emitted versus wavelength
for a blackbody at different
temperatures
Notice that the wavelength λm for which energy
is the maximum decreases with increasing
temperature. The relation between λm and T is
given by what is known as Wien’s Displacement
Law:
λm T = constant
(10.15)
The value of the constant (Wien’s constant)
is 2.9 × 10–3 m K. This law explains why the
colour of a piece of iron heated in a hot flame
first becomes dull red, then reddish yellow, and
finally white hot. Wien’s law is useful for
estimating the surface temperatures of celestial



THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER

219

bodies like, the moon, Sun and other stars. Light
from the moon is found to have a maximum
intensity near the wavelength 14 µm. By Wien’s
law, the surface of the moon is estimated to have
a temperature of 200 K. Solar radiation has a
maximum at λm = 4753 Å. This corresponds to
T = 6060 K. Remember, this is the temperature
of the surface of the sun, not its interior.
The most significant feature of the
blackbody radiation curves in Fig. 10.18 is that
they are universal. They depend only on the
temperature and not on the size, shape or
material of the blackbody. Attempts to explain
blackbody radiation theoretically, at the
beginning of the twentieth century, spurred the
quantum revolution in physics, as you will
learn in later courses.
Energy can be transferred by radiation over
large distances, without a medium (i.e., in
vacuum). The total electromagnetic energy
radiated by a body at absolute temperature T
is proportional to its size, its ability to radiate
(called emissivity) and most importantly to its
temperature. For a body, which is a perfect
radiator, the energy emitted per unit time (H)
is given by
H = AσT 4

(10.16)

where A is the area and T is the absolute
temperature of the body. This relation obtained
experimentally by Stefan and later proved
theoretically by Boltzmann is known as StefanBoltzmann law and the constant σ is called
Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Its value in SI units
is 5.67 × 10–8 W m–2 K–4. Most bodies emit only a
fraction of the rate given by Eq. 10.16. A substance
like lamp black comes close to the limit. One,
therefore, defines a dimensionless fraction e
called emissivity and writes,
H = AeσT 4
(10.17)
Here, e = 1 for a perfect radiator. For a tungsten
lamp, for example, e is about 0.4. Thus, a tungsten
lamp at a temperature of 3000 K and a surface
area of 0.3 cm2 radiates at the rate H = 0.3 ×
10–4 × 0.4 × 5.67 × 10–8 × (3000)4 = 60 W.
A body at temperature T, with surroundings
at temperatures Ts, emits, as well as, receives
energy. For a perfect radiator, the net rate of
loss of radiant energy is
H = σA (T 4 – Ts4)

For a body with emissivity e, the relation
modifies to
H = eσ A (T 4 – Ts4)

(10.18)

As an example, let us estimate the heat
radiated by our bodies. Suppose the surface area
of a person’s body is about 1.9 m2 and the room
temperature is 22 ° C. The internal body
temperature, as we know, is about 37°°C. The
skin temperature may be 28° °C (say). The
emissivity of the skin is about 0.97 for the
relevant region of electromagnetic radiation. The
rate of heat loss is:
H = 5.67 × 10–8 × 1.9 × 0.97 × {(301)4 – (295)4}
= 66.4 W
which is more than half the rate of energy
production by the body at rest (120 W). To
prevent this heat loss effectively (better than
ordinary clothing), modern arctic clothing has
an additional thin shiny metallic layer next to
the skin, which reflects the body’s radiation.
10.10 NEWTON’S LAW OF COOLING
We all know that hot water or milk when left on
a table begins to cool, gradually. Ultimately it
attains the temperature of the surroundings. To
study how slow or fast a given body can cool on
exchanging heat with its surroundings, let us
perform the following activity.
T a k e s o m e w a t e r, s a y 3 0 0 m L , i n a
calorimeter with a stirrer and cover it with a
two-holed lid. Fix the stirrer through one hole
and fix a thermometer through another hole
in the lid and make sure that the bulb of
thermometer is immersed in the water. Note
the reading of the thermometer. This reading
T1 is the temperature of the surroundings.
Heat the water kept in the calorimeter till it
attains a temperature, say 40 °C above room
temperature (i.e., temperature of the
surroundings). Then, stop heating the water
by removing the heat source. Start the
stop-watch and note the reading of the
thermometer after a fixed interval of time, say
after every one minute of stirring gently with
the stirrer. Continue to note the temperature
(T2) of water till it attains a temperature about
5 °C above that of the surroundings. Then, plot

a graph by taking each value of temperature
∆T = T2 – T1 along y-axis and the coresponding
value of t along x-axis (Fig. 10.19).

Fig. 10.19 Curve showing cooling of hot water
with time.

From the graph you can infer how the cooling
of hot water depends on the difference of its
temperature from that of the surroundings. You
will also notice that initially the rate of cooling
is higher and decreases as the temperature of
the body falls.
The above activity shows that a hot body loses
heat to its surroundings in the form of heat
radiation. The rate of loss of heat depends on
the difference in temperature between the body
and its surroundings. Newton was the first to
study, in a systematic manner, the relation
between the heat lost by a body in a given
enclosure and its temperature.
According to Newton’s law of cooling, the rate
of loss of heat, – dQ/dt of the body is directly
proportional to the difference of temperature
∆T = (T2–T1) of the body and the surroundings.
The law holds good only for small difference of
temperature. Also, the loss of heat by radiation
depends upon the nature of the surface of the
body and the area of the exposed surface. We
can write
–

(10.19)

where k is a positive constant depending upon
the area and nature of the surface of the body.
Suppose a body of mass m and specific heat
capacity s is at temperature T2. Let T1 be the
temperature of the surroundings. If the
temperature falls by a small amount dT2 in time
dt, then the amount of heat lost is
dQ = ms dT2
∴ Rate of loss of heat is given by

dQ
dT
= ms 2

(10.21)

(10.22)
(10.23)

Equation (10.23) enables you to calculate the
time of cooling of a body through a particular
range of temperature.
For small temperature differences, the rate
of cooling, due to conduction, convection, and
radiation combined, is proportional to the
difference in temperature. It is a valid
approximation in the transfer of heat from a
radiator to a room, the loss of heat through the
wall of a room, or the cooling of a cup of tea on
the table.

Fig. 10.20 Verification of Newton’s Law of cooling.

Newton’s law of cooling can be verified with
the help of the experimental set-up shown in
Fig. 10.20(a). The set-up consists of a doublewalled vessel (V) containing water between
the two walls. A copper calorimeter (C)
containing hot water is placed inside the
double-walled vessel. Two thermometers
through the corks are used to note the
temperatures T2 of water in calorimeter and
T1 of hot water in between the double walls,
respectively. Temperature of hot water in the
calorimeter is noted after equal intervals of
time. A graph is plotted between log e (T2–T1)
[or ln(T2–T1)] and time (t ). The nature of the



THERMAL PROPERTIES OF MATTER

graph is observed to be a straight line having
a negative slope as shown in Fig. 10.20(b). This
is in support of Eq. 10.22.

The average of 69 °C and 71 °C is 70 °C, which
is 50 °C above room temperature. K is the same
for this situation as for the original.

Example 10.8 A pan filled with hot food
cools from 94 °C to 86 °C in 2 minutes when
the room temperature is at 20 °C. How long
will it take to cool from 71 °C to 69 °C?

⊳

Answer The average temperature of 94 °C and
86 °C is 90 °C, which is 70 °C above the room
temperature. Under these conditions the pan
cools 8 °C in 2 minutes.
Using Eq. (10.21), we have

SUMMARY
1.

Heat is a form of energy that flows between a body and its surrounding medium by
virtue of temperature difference between them. The degree of hotness of the body is
quantitatively represented by temperature.

2.

A temperature-measuring device (thermometer) makes use of some measurable property
(called thermometric property) that changes with temperature. Different thermometers
lead to different temperature scales. To construct a temperature scale, two fixed points
are chosen and assigned some arbitrary values of temperature. The two numbers fix
the origin of the scale and the size of its unit.

3.

The Celsius temperature (tC) and the Farenheit temperare (tF)are related by
tF = (9/5) tC + 32

4.

The ideal gas equation connecting pressure (P), volume (V) and absolute temperature (T)
is :
PV = µRT
where µ is the number of moles and R is the universal gas constant.

5.

In the absolute temperature scale, the zero of the scale corresponds to the temperature
where every substance in nature has the least possible molecular activity. The Kelvin
absolute temperature scale (T ) has the same unit size as the Celsius scale (Tc ), but
differs in the origin :
TC = T – 273.15

6.

The coefficient of linear expansion (αl ) and volume expansion (αv ) are defined by the
relations :

∆l
= α l ∆T
l

∆V
= α V ∆T
V



⊳

222

PHYSICS

where ∆l and ∆V denote the change in length l and volume V for a change of temperature
∆T. The relation between them is :

αv = 3 αl
7.

The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by

s=

1 ∆Q
m ∆T

where m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its
temperature by ∆T. The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by

C=

1 ∆Q
µ ∆T

where µ is the number of moles of the substance.
8.

The latent heat of fusion (Lf) is the heat per unit mass required to change a substance
from solid into liquid at the same temperature and pressure. The latent heat of
vaporisation (Lv) is the heat per unit mass required to change a substance from liquid
to the vapour state without change in the temperature and pressure.

9.

The three modes of heat transfer are conduction, convection and radiation.

10. In conduction, heat is transferred between neighbouring parts of a body through
molecular collisions, without any flow of matter. For a bar of length L and uniform
cross section A with its ends maintained at temperatures TC and TD, the rate of flow of
heat H is :

T −T
H=K A

C

D

L

where K is the thermal conductivity of the material of the bar.
11. Newton’s Law of Cooling says that the rate of cooling of a body is proportional to the
excess temperature of the body over the surroundings :

dQ
= – k (T2 – T1 )
dt

Where T1 is the temperature of the surrounding medium and T2 is the temperature of
the body.

POINTS TO PONDER
1. The relation connecting Kelvin temperature (T ) and the Celsius temperature tc
T = tc + 273.15
and the assignment T = 273.16 K for the triple point of water are exact relations (by
choice). With this choice, the Celsius temperature of the melting point of water and
boiling point of water (both at 1 atm pressure) are very close to, but not exactly equal
to 0 °C and 100 °C respectively. In the original Celsius scale, these latter fixed points
were exactly at 0 °C and 100 °C (by choice), but now the triple point of water is the
preferred choice for the fixed point, because it has a unique temperature.
2.

A liquid in equilibrium with vapour has the same pressure and temperature throughout
the system; the two phases in equilibrium differ in their molar volume (i.e. density).
This is true for a system with any number of phases in equilibrium.

3.

Heat transfer always involves temperature difference between two systems or two parts
of the same system. Any energy transfer that does not involve temperature difference
in some way is not heat.

4.

Convection involves flow of matter within a fluid due to unequal temperatures of its
parts. A hot bar placed under a running tap loses heat by conduction between the
surface of the bar and water and not by convection within water.

on this (Kelvin) scale ?

11.1 INTRODUCTION
In previous chapter we have studied thermal properties of
matter. In this chapter we shall study laws that govern
thermal energy. We shall study the processes where work is
converted into heat and vice versa. In winter, when we rub
our palms together, we feel warmer; here work done in rubbing
produces the ‘heat’. Conversely, in a steam engine, the ‘heat’
of the steam is used to do useful work in moving the pistons,
which in turn rotate the wheels of the train.
In physics, we need to define the notions of heat,
temperature, work, etc. more carefully. Historically, it took a
long time to arrive at the proper concept of ‘heat’. Before the
modern picture, heat was regarded as a fine invisible fluid
filling in the pores of a substance. On contact between a hot
body and a cold body, the fluid (called caloric) flowed from
the colder to the hotter body ! This is similar to what happens
when a horizontal pipe connects two tanks containing water
up to different heights. The flow continues until the levels of
water in the two tanks are the same. Likewise, in the ‘caloric’
picture of heat, heat flows until the ‘caloric levels’ (i.e., the
temperatures) equalise.
In time, the picture of heat as a fluid was discarded in
favour of the modern concept of heat as a form of energy. An
important experiment in this connection was due to Benjamin
Thomson (also known as Count Rumford) in 1798. He
observed that boring of a brass cannon generated a lot of
heat, indeed enough to boil water. More significantly, the
amount of heat produced depended on the work done (by the
horses employed for turning the drill) but not on the
sharpness of the drill. In the caloric picture, a sharper drill
would scoop out more heat fluid from the pores; but this
was not observed. A most natural explanation of the
observations was that heat was a form of energy and the
experiment demonstrated conversion of energy from one form
to another–from work to heat.

Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that
deals with the concepts of heat and temperature
and the inter-conversion of heat and other forms
of energy. Thermodynamics is a macroscopic
science. It deals with bulk systems and does not
go into the molecular constitution of matter. In
fact, its concepts and laws were formulated in the
nineteenth century before the molecular picture
of matter was firmly established. Thermodynamic
description involves relatively few macroscopic
variables of the system, which are suggested by
common sense and can be usually measured
directly. A microscopic description of a gas, for
example, would involve specifying the co-ordinates
and velocities of the huge number of molecules
constituting the gas. The description in kinetic
theory of gases is not so detailed but it does involve
molecular
distribution
of
velocities.
Thermodynamic description of a gas, on the other
hand, avoids the molecular description altogether.
Instead, the state of a gas in thermodynamics is
specified by macroscopic variables such as
pressure, volume, temperature, mass and
composition that are felt by our sense perceptions
and are measurable*.
The distinction between mechanics and
thermodynamics is worth bearing in mind. In
mechanics, our interest is in the motion of particles
or bodies under the action of forces and torques.
Thermodynamics is not concerned with the
motion of the system as a whole. It is concerned
with the internal macroscopic state of the body.
When a bullet is fired from a gun, what changes
is the mechanical state of the bullet (its kinetic
energy, in particular), not its temperature. When
the bullet pierces a wood and stops, the kinetic
energy of the bullet gets converted into heat,
changing the temperature of the bullet and the
surrounding layers of wood. Temperature is
related to the energy of the internal (disordered)
motion of the bullet, not to the motion of the bullet
as a whole.
11.2 THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM
Equilibrium in mechanics means that the net
external force and torque on a system are zero.
The term ‘equilibrium’ in thermodynamics appears
*

in a different context : we say the state of a system
is an equilibrium state if the macroscopic
variables that characterise the system do not
change in time. For example, a gas inside a closed
rigid container, completely insulated from its
surroundings, with fixed values of pressure,
volume, temperature, mass and composition that
do not change with time, is in a state of
thermodynamic equilibrium.

Fig. 11.1 (a) Systems A and B (two gases) separated
by an adiabatic wall – an insulating wall
that does not allow flow of heat. (b) The
same systems A and B separated by a
diathermic wall – a conducting wall that
allows heat to flow from one to another. In
this case, thermal equilibrium is attained
in due course.

In general, whether or not a system is in a state
of equilibrium depends on the surroundings and
the nature of the wall that separates the system
from the surroundings. Consider two gases A and
B occupying two different containers. We know
experimentally that pressure and volume of a
given mass of gas can be chosen to be its two
independent variables. Let the pressure and
volume of the gases be (PA, VA) and (PB, VB)
respectively. Suppose first that the two systems
are put in proximity but are separated by an

Thermodynamics may also involve other variables that are not so obvious to our senses e.g. entropy, enthalpy,
etc., and they are all macroscopic variables. However, a thermodynamic state is specified by five state
variables viz., pressure, volume, temperature, internal energy and entropy. Entropy is a measure of disorderness
in the system. Enthalpy is a measure of total heat content of the system.

adiabatic wall – an insulating wall (can be
movable) that does not allow flow of energy (heat)
from one to another. The systems are insulated
from the rest of the surroundings also by similar
adiabatic walls. The situation is shown
schematically in Fig. 11.1 (a). In this case, it is
found that any possible pair of values (PA, VA) will
be in equilibrium with any possible pair of values
(PB, VB ). Next, suppose that the adiabatic wall is
replaced by a diathermic wall – a conducting wall
that allows energy flow (heat) from one to another.
It is then found that the macroscopic variables of
the systems A and B change spontaneously until
both the systems attain equilibrium states. After
that there is no change in their states. The
situation is shown in Fig. 11.1(b). The pressure
and volume variables of the two gases change to
(PB ′, VB ′) and (PA ′, VA ′) such that the new states
of A and B are in equilibrium with each other*.
There is no more energy flow from one to another.
We then say that the system A is in thermal
equilibrium with the system B.
What characterises the situation of thermal
equilibrium between two systems ? You can guess
the answer from your experience. In thermal
equilibrium, the temperatures of the two systems
are equal. We shall see how does one arrive at the
concept of temperature in thermodynamics? The
Zeroth law of thermodynamics provides the clue.

law in 1931 long after the first and second Laws
of thermodynamics were stated and so numbered.
The Zeroth Law clearly suggests that when two
systems A and B, are in thermal equilibrium,
there must be a physical quantity that has the
same value for both. This thermodynamic
variable whose value is equal for two systems in
thermal equilibrium is called temperature (T ).
Thus, if A and B are separately in equilibrium
with C, TA = TC and TB = TC. This implies that
TA = TB i.e. the systems A and B are also in
thermal equilibrium.
We have arrived at the concept of temperature
formally via the Zeroth Law. The next question
is : how to assign numerical values to
temperatures of different bodies ? In other words,
how do we construct a scale of temperature ?
Thermometry deals with this basic question to
which we turn in the next section.

11.3 ZEROTH LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS

(a)

Imagine two systems A and B, separated by an
adiabatic wall, while each is in contact with a third
system C, via a conducting wall [Fig. 11.2(a)]. The
states of the systems (i.e., their macroscopic
variables) will change until both A and B come to
thermal equilibrium with C. After this is achieved,
suppose that the adiabatic wall between A and B
is replaced by a conducting wall and C is insulated
from A and B by an adiabatic wall [Fig.11.2(b)]. It
is found that the states of A and B change no
further i.e. they are found to be in thermal
equilibrium with each other. This observation
forms the basis of the Zeroth Law of
Thermodynamics, which states that ‘two
systems in thermal equilibrium with a third
system separately are in thermal equilibrium
with each other’. R.H. Fowler formulated this

adiabatic wall, while each is in contact
with a third system C via a conducting
wall. (b) The adiabatic wall between A
and B is replaced by a conducting wall,
while C is insulated from A and B by an
adiabatic wall.

Both the variables need not change. It depends on the constraints. For instance, if the gases are in containers
of fixed volume, only the pressures of the gases would change to achieve thermal equilibrium.

11.4 HEAT, INTERNAL ENERGY AND WORK
The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics led us to
the concept of temperature that agrees with our
commonsense notion. Temperature is a marker
of the ‘hotness’ of a body. It determines the
direction of flow of heat when two bodies are
placed in thermal contact. Heat flows from the
body at a higher temperature to the one at lower
temperature. The flow stops when the
temperatures equalise; the two bodies are then
in thermal equilibrium. We saw in some detail
how to construct temperature scales to assign
temperatures to different bodies. We now
describe the concepts of heat and other relevant
quantities like internal energy and work.
The concept of internal energy of a system is
not difficult to understand. We know that every
bulk system consists of a large number of
molecules. Internal energy is simply the sum of
the kinetic energies and potential energies of
these molecules. We remarked earlier that in
thermodynamics, the kinetic energy of the
system, as a whole, is not relevant. Internal
energy is thus, the sum of molecular kinetic and
potential energies in the frame of reference
relative to which the centre of mass of the system
is at rest. Thus, it includes only the (disordered)
energy associated with the random motion of
molecules of the system. We denote the internal
energy of a system by U.
Though we have invoked the molecular
picture to understand the meaning of internal
energy, as far as thermodynamics is concerned,
U is simply a macroscopic variable of the system.
The important thing about internal energy is
that it depends only on the state of the system,
not on how that state was achieved. Internal
energy U of a system is an example of a
thermodynamic ‘state variable’ – its value
depends only on the given state of the system,
not on history i.e. not on the ‘path’ taken to arrive
at that state. Thus, the internal energy of a given
mass of gas depends on its state described by
specific values of pressure, volume and
temperature. It does not depend on how this
state of the gas came about. Pressure, volume,
temperature, and internal energy are
thermodynamic state variables of the system
(gas) (see section 11.7). If we neglect the small
intermolecular forces in a gas, the internal
energy of a gas is just the sum of kinetic energies

associated with various random motions of its
molecules. We will see in the next chapter that
in a gas this motion is not only translational
(i.e. motion from one point to another in the
volume of the container); it also includes
rotational and vibrational motion of the
molecules (Fig. 11.3).

Fig. 11.3 (a) Internal energy U of a gas is the sum
of the kinetic and potential energies of its
molecules when the box is at rest. Kinetic
energy due to various types of motion
(translational, rotational, vibrational) is to
be included in U. (b) If the same box is
moving as a whole with some velocity,
the kinetic energy of the box is not to be
included in U.

Fig. 11.4 Heat and work are two distinct modes of
energy transfer to a system that results in
change in its internal energy. (a) Heat is
energy transfer due to temperature
difference between the system and the
surroundings. (b) Work is energy transfer
brought about by means (e.g. moving the
piston by raising or lowering some weight
connected to it) that do not involve such a
temperature difference.



230

PHYSICS

What are the ways of changing internal
energy of a system ? Consider again, for
simplicity, the system to be a certain mass of
gas contained in a cylinder with a movable
piston as shown in Fig. 11.4. Experience shows
there are two ways of changing the state of the
gas (and hence its internal energy). One way is
to put the cylinder in contact with a body at a
higher temperature than that of the gas. The
temperature difference will cause a flow of
energy (heat) from the hotter body to the gas,
thus increasing the internal energy of the gas.
The other way is to push the piston down i.e. to
do work on the system, which again results in
increasing the internal energy of the gas. Of
course, both these things could happen in the
reverse direction. With surroundings at a lower
temperature, heat would flow from the gas to
the surroundings. Likewise, the gas could push
the piston up and do work on the surroundings.
In short, heat and work are two different modes
of altering the state of a thermodynamic system
and changing its internal energy.
The notion of heat should be carefully
distinguished from the notion of internal energy.
Heat is certainly energy, but it is the energy in
transit. This is not just a play of words. The
distinction is of basic significance. The state of
a thermodynamic system is characterised by its
internal energy, not heat. A statement like ‘a
gas in a given state has a certain amount of
heat’ is as meaningless as the statement that
‘a gas in a given state has a certain amount
of work’. In contrast, ‘a gas in a given state
has a certain amount of internal energy’ is a
perfectly meaningful statement. Similarly, the
statements ‘a certain amount of heat is
supplied to the system’ or ‘a certain amount
of work was done by the system’ are perfectly
meaningful.
To summarise, heat and work in
thermodynamics are not state variables. They
are modes of energy transfer to a system
resulting in change in its internal energy,
which, as already mentioned, is a state variable.
In ordinary language, we often confuse heat
with internal energy. The distinction between
them is sometimes ignored in elementary
physics books. For proper understanding of
thermodynamics, however, the distinction is
crucial.

11.5 FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
We have seen that the internal energy U of a
system can change through two modes of energy
transfer : heat and work. Let
∆Q = Heat supplied to the system by the
surroundings
∆W = Work done by the system on the
surroundings
∆U = Change in internal energy of the system
The general principle of conservation of
energy then implies that
∆Q = ∆U + ∆W
(11.1)
i.e. the energy (∆Q) supplied to the system goes
in partly to increase the internal energy of the
system (∆U) and the rest in work on the
environment (∆W). Equation (11.1) is known as
the First Law of Thermodynamics. It is simply
the general law of conservation of energy applied
to any system in which the energy transfer from
or to the surroundings is taken into account.
Let us put Eq. (11.1) in the alternative form
∆Q – ∆W = ∆U

(11.2)

Now, the system may go from an initial state
to the final state in a number of ways. For
example, to change the state of a gas from
(P1, V1) to (P2, V2), we can first change the
volume of the gas from V1 to V2, keeping its
pressure constant i.e. we can first go the state
(P1, V2) and then change the pressure of the
gas from P1 to P2, keeping volume constant, to
take the gas to (P2, V2). Alternatively, we can
first keep the volume constant and then keep
the pressure constant. Since U is a state
variable, ∆U depends only on the initial and
final states and not on the path taken by the
gas to go from one to the other. However, ∆Q
and ∆W will, in general, depend on the path
taken to go from the initial to final states. From
the First Law of Thermodynamics, Eq. (11.2),
it is clear that the combination ∆Q – ∆W, is
however, path independent. This shows that
if a system is taken through a process in which
∆U = 0 (for example, isothermal expansion of
an ideal gas, see section 11.8),
∆Q = ∆W
i.e., heat supplied to the system is used up
entirely by the system in doing work on the
environment.



THERMODYNAMICS

231

If the system is a gas in a cylinder with a
movable piston, the gas in moving the piston does
work. Since force is pressure times area, and
area times displacement is volume, work done
by the system against a constant pressure P is

C=

∆W = P ∆V
where ∆V is the change in volume of the gas.
Thus, for this case, Eq. (11.1) gives
∆Q = ∆U + P ∆V

(11.3)

As an application of Eq. (11.3), consider the
change in internal energy for 1 g of water when
we go from its liquid to vapour phase. The
measured latent heat of water is 2256 J/g. i.e.,
for 1 g of water ∆Q = 2256 J. At atmospheric
pressure, 1 g of water has a volume 1 cm3 in
liquid phase and 1671 cm3 in vapour phase.
Therefore,
∆W =P (Vg –Vl ) = 1.013 ×105 × (1671 × 10–6) =169.2 J
Equation (11.3) then gives
∆U = 2256 – 169.2 = 2086.8 J
We see that most of the heat goes to increase
the internal energy of water in transition from
the liquid to the vapour phase.
11.6 SPECIFIC HEAT CAPACITY
Suppose an amount of heat ∆Q supplied to a
substance changes its temperature from T to
T + ∆T. We define heat capacity of a substance
(see Chapter 10) to be
∆Q
S=
∆T

If the amount of substance is specified in
terms of moles µ (instead of mass m in kg ), we
can define heat capacity per mole of the
substance by

(11.4)

We expect ∆Q and, therefore, heat capacity S
to be proportional to the mass of the substance.
Further, it could also depend on the
temperature, i.e., a different amount of heat may
be needed for a unit rise in temperature at
different temperatures. To define a constant
characteristic of the substance and
independent of its amount, we divide S by the
mass of the substance m in kg :

s is known as the specific heat capacity of the
substance. It depends on the nature of the
substance and its temperature. The unit of
specific heat capacity is J kg–1 K–1.

S

µ

1 ∆Q
µ ∆T

(11.6)

C is known as molar specific heat capacity of
the substance. Like s, C is independent of the
amount of substance. C depends on the nature
of the substance, its temperature and the
conditions under which heat is supplied. The
unit of C is J mo1–1 K–1. As we shall see later (in
connection with specific heat capacity of gases),
additional conditions may be needed to define
C or s. The idea in defining C is that simple
predictions can be made in regard to molar
specific heat capacities.
Table 11.1 lists measured specific and molar
heat capacities of solids at atmospheric pressure
and ordinary room temperature.
We will see in Chapter 12 that predictions of
specific heats of gases generally agree with
experiment. We can use the same law of
equipartition of energy that we use there to
predict molar specific heat capacities of solids
(See Section 12.5 and 12.6). Consider a solid of
N atoms, each vibrating about its mean
position. An oscillator in one dimension has
average energy of 2 × ½ kBT = kBT. In three
dimensions, the average energy is 3 k BT.
For a mole of a solid, the total energy is
U = 3 kBT × NA = 3 RT (∵ kBT × NA = R )
Now, at constant pressure, ∆Q = ∆U + P ∆V ≅
∆U, since for a solid ∆V is negligible. Therefore,

Specific heat capacity of water

where C p and C v are molar specific heat
capacities of an ideal gas at constant pressure
and volume respectively and R is the universal
gas constant. To prove the relation, we begin
with Eq. (11.3) for 1 mole of the gas :

The old unit of heat was calorie. One calorie
was earlier defined to be the amount of heat
required to raise the temperature of 1g of water
by 1°C. With more precise measurements, it was
found that the specific heat of water varies
slightly with temperature. Figure 11.5 shows
this variation in the temperature range 0 to
100 °C.

Fig. 11.5 Variation of specific heat capacity of
water with temperature.

For a precise definition of calorie, it was,
therefore, necessary to specify the unit
temperature interval. One calorie is defined
to be the amount of heat required to raise the
temperature of 1g of water from 14.5 °C to
15.5 °C. Since heat is just a form of energy,
it is preferable to use the unit joule, J.
In SI units, the specific heat capacity of water
is 4186 J kg–1 K–1 i.e. 4.186 J g–1 K–1. The so
called mechanical equivalent of heat defined
as the amount of work needed to produce
1 cal of heat is in fact just a conversion factor
between two different units of energy : calorie
to joule. Since in SI units, we use the unit joule
for heat, work or any other form of energy, the
term mechanical equivalent is now
superfluous and need not be used.
As already remarked, the specific heat
capacity depends on the process or the
conditions under which heat capacity transfer
takes place. For gases, for example, we can
define two specific heats : specific heat
capacity at constant volume and specific
heat capacity at constant pressure. For an

relation, Eq. (11.8).
11.7THERMODYNAMIC STATE VARIABLES
AND EQUATION OF STATE
Every equilibrium state of a thermodynamic
system is completely described by specific
values of some macroscopic variables, also
called state variables. For example, an
equilibrium state of a gas is completely
specified by the values of pressure, volume,
temperature, and mass (and composition if
there is a mixture of gases). A thermodynamic
system is not always in equilibrium. For example,
a gas allowed to expand freely against vacuum
is not an equilibrium state [Fig. 11.6(a)]. During
the rapid expansion, pressure of the gas may



THERMODYNAMICS

233

not be uniform throughout. Similarly, a mixture
of gases undergoing an explosive chemical
reaction (e.g. a mixture of petrol vapour and
air when ignited by a spark) is not an
equilibrium state; again its temperature and
pressure are not uniform [Fig. 11.6(b)].
Eventually, the gas attains a uniform
temperature and pressure and comes to
thermal and mechanical equilibrium with its
surroundings.

temperature do not. To decide which variable is
extensive and which intensive, think of a
relevant system in equilibrium, and imagine that
it is divided into two equal parts. The variables
that remain unchanged for each part are
intensive. The variables whose values get halved
in each part are extensive. It is easily seen, for
example, that internal energy U, volume V, total
mass M are extensive variables. Pressure P,
temperature T, and density ρ are intensive
variables. It is a good practice to check the
consistency of thermodynamic equations using
this classification of variables. For example, in
the equation
∆Q = ∆U + P ∆V
quantities on both sides are extensive*. (The
product of an intensive variable like P and an
extensive quantity ∆V is extensive.)
11.8 THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES

Fig. 11.6 (a) The partition in the box is suddenly
removed leading to free expansion of the
gas. (b) A mixture of gases undergoing an
explosive chemical reaction. In both
situations, the gas is not in equilibrium and
cannot be described by state variables.

In short, thermodynamic state variables
describe equilibrium states of systems. The
various state variables are not necessarily
independent. The connection between the state
variables is called the equation of state. For
example, for an ideal gas, the equation of state
is the ideal gas relation
PV=µRT
For a fixed amount of the gas i.e. given µ, there
are thus, only two independent variables, say P
and V or T and V. The pressure-volume curve
for a fixed temperature is called an isotherm.
Real gases may have more complicated
equations of state.
The thermodynamic state variables are of two
kinds: extensive and intensive. Extensive
variables indicate the ‘size’ of the system.
Intensive variables such as pressure and

11.8.1 Quasi-static process
Consider a gas in thermal and mechanical
equilibrium with its surroundings. The pressure
of the gas in that case equals the external
pressure and its temperature is the same as
that of its surroundings. Suppose that the
external pressure is suddenly reduced (say by
lifting the weight on the movable piston in the
container). The piston will accelerate outward.
During the process, the gas passes through
states that are not equilibrium states. The nonequilibrium states do not have well-defined
pressure and temperature. In the same way, if
a finite temperature difference exists between
the gas and its surroundings, there will be a
rapid exchange of heat during which the gas
will pass through non-equilibrium states. In
due course, the gas will settle to an equilibrium
state with well-defined temperature and
pressure equal to those of the surroundings. The
free expansion of a gas in vacuum and a mixture
of gases undergoing an explosive chemical
reaction, mentioned in section 11.7 are also
examples where the system goes through nonequilibrium states.
Non-equilibrium states of a system are difficult
to deal with. It is, therefore, convenient to
imagine an idealised process in which at every
stage the system is an equilibrium state. Such a

* As emphasised earlier, Q is not a state variable. However, ∆Q is clearly proportional to the total mass of
system and hence is extensive.



234

PHYSICS

process is, in principle, infinitely slow, hence the
name quasi-static (meaning nearly static). The
system changes its variables (P, T, V ) so slowly
that it remains in thermal and mechanical
equilibrium with its surroundings throughout.
In a quasi-static process, at every stage, the
difference in the pressure of the system and the
external pressure is infinitesimally small. The
same is true of the temperature difference
between the system and its surroundings
(Fig.11.7). To take a gas from the state (P, T ) to
another state (P ′, T ′ ) via a quasi-static process,
we change the external pressure by a very small
amount, allow the system to equalise its pressure
with that of the surroundings and continue the
process infinitely slowly until the system
achieves the pressure P ′. Similarly, to change
the temperature, we introduce an infinitesimal
temperature difference between the system and
the surrounding reservoirs and by choosing
reservoirs of progressively different temperatures
T to T ′, the system achieves the temperature T ′.

A process in which the temperature of the
system is kept fixed throughout is called an
isothermal process. The expansion of a gas in
a metallic cylinder placed in a large reservoir of
fixed temperature is an example of an isothermal
process. (Heat transferred from the reservoir to
the system does not materially affect the
temperature of the reservoir, because of its very
large heat capacity.) In isobaric processes the
pressure is constant while in isochoric
processes the volume is constant. Finally, if the
system is insulated from the surroundings and
no heat flows between the system and the
surroundings, the process is adiabatic. The
definitions of these special processes are
summarised in Table. 11.2

Some special thermodynamic
processes

We now consider these processes in some detail :

11.8.2 Isothermal process

Fig. 11.7

In a quasi-static process, the temperature
of the surrounding reservoir and the
external pressure differ only infinitesimally
from the temperature and pressure of the
system.

A quasi-static process is obviously a
hypothetical construct. In practice, processes
that are sufficiently slow and do not involve
accelerated motion of the piston, large
temperature gradient, etc., are reasonably
approximation to an ideal quasi-static process.
We shall from now on deal with quasi-static
processes only, except when stated otherwise.

For an isothermal process (T fixed), the ideal gas
equation gives
PV = constant
i.e., pressure of a given mass of gas varies inversely
as its volume. This is nothing but Boyle’s Law.
Suppose an ideal gas goes isothermally (at
temperature T ) from its initial state (P1, V1) to
the final state (P2, V 2). At any intermediate stage
with pressure P and volume change from V to
V + ∆V (∆V small)
∆W = P ∆ V
Taking (∆V → 0) and summing the quantity
∆W over the entire process,

where in the second step we have made use of
the ideal gas equation PV = µ RT and taken the
constants out of the integral. For an ideal gas,
internal energy depends only on temperature.
Thus, there is no change in the internal energy
of an ideal gas in an isothermal process. The
First Law of Thermodynamics then implies that
heat supplied to the gas equals the work done
by the gas : Q = W. Note from Eq. (11.12) that
for V2 > V1, W > 0; and for V2 < V1, W < 0. That
is, in an isothermal expansion, the gas absorbs
heat and does work while in an isothermal
compression, work is done on the gas by the
environment and heat is released.

11.8.3 Adiabatic process
In an adiabatic process, the system is insulated
from the surroundings and heat absorbed or
released is zero. From Eq. (11.1), we see that
work done by the gas results in decrease in its
internal energy (and hence its temperature for
an ideal gas). We quote without proof (the result
that you will learn in higher courses) that for
an adiabatic process of an ideal gas.
P V γ = const
(11.13)
where γ is the ratio of specific heats (ordinary
or molar) at constant pressure and at constant
volume.

Thus if an ideal gas undergoes a change in
its state adiabatically from (P1, V1) to (P2, V2) :

(11.14)

Figure11.8 shows the P-V curves of an ideal
gas for two adiabatic processes connecting two
isotherms.

We can calculate, as before, the work done in
an adiabatic change of an ideal gas from the
state (P1, V1, T1) to the state (P2, V2, T2).
V2
W = ∫ P dV
V1

From Eq. (11.14), the constant is P1V1γ or P2V2γ

(11.16)

As expected, if work is done by the gas in an
adiabatic process (W > 0), from Eq. (11.16),
T2 < T1. On the other hand, if work is done on
the gas (W < 0), we get T 2 > T 1 i.e., the
temperature of the gas rises.

11.8.4 Isochoric process
In an isochoric process, V is constant. No work
is done on or by the gas. From Eq. (11.1), the
heat absorbed by the gas goes entirely to change
its internal energy and its temperature. The
change in temperature for a given amount of
heat is determined by the specific heat of the
gas at constant volume.

11.8.5 Isobaric process
In an isobaric process, P is fixed. Work done by
the gas is
W = P (V2 – V1) = µ R (T2 – T1)

(11.17)

Since temperature changes, so does internal
energy. The heat absorbed goes partly to
increase internal energy and partly to do work.
The change in temperature for a given amount
of heat is determined by the specific heat of the
gas at constant pressure.

11.8.6 Cyclic process
Fig. 11.8

P-V curves for isothermal and adiabatic
processes of an ideal gas.

In a cyclic process, the system returns to its
initial state. Since internal energy is a state
variable, ∆U = 0 for a cyclic process. From



236

PHYSICS

Eq. (11.1), the total heat absorbed equals the
work done by the system.
11.9 SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS
The First Law of Thermodynamics is the
principle of conservation of energy. Common
experience shows that there are many
conceivable processes that are perfectly
allowed by the First Law and yet are never
observed. For example, nobody has ever seen
a book lying on a table jumping to a height by
itself. But such a thing would be possible if
the principle of conservation of energy were
the only restriction. The table could cool
spontaneously, converting some of its internal
energy into an equal amount of mechanical
energy of the book, which would then hop to a
height with potential energy equal to the
mechanical energy it acquired. But this never
happens. Clearly, some additional basic
principle of nature forbids the above, even
though it satisfies the energy conservation
principle. This principle, which disallows
many phenomena consistent with the First
Law of Thermodynamics is known as the
Second Law of Thermodynamics.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics gives
a fundamental limitation to the efficiency of a
heat engine and the co-efficient of
performance of a refrigerator. In simple terms,
it says that efficiency of a heat engine can
never be unity. For a refrigerator, the Second
Law says that the co-efficient of performance
can never be infinite. The following two
statements, one due to Kelvin and Planck
denying the possibility of a perfect heat engine,
and another due to Clausius denying the
possibility of a perfect refrigerator or heat
pump, are a concise summary of these
observations.
Kelvin-Planck statement
No process is possible whose sole result is the
absorption of heat from a reservoir and the
complete conversion of the heat into work.
Clausius statement
No process is possible whose sole result is the
transfer of heat from a colder object to a
hotter object.
It can be proved that the two statements
above are completely equivalent.

11.10

REVERSIBLE AND IRREVERSIBLE
PROCESSES
Imagine some process in which a thermodynamic
system goes from an initial state i to a final state
f. During the process the system absorbs heat Q
from the surroundings and performs work W on
it. Can we reverse this process and bring both
the system and surroundings to their initial
states with no other effect anywhere ? Experience
suggests that for most processes in nature this
is not possible. The spontaneous processes of
nature are irreversible. Several examples can be
cited. The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter
than its other parts. When the vessel is removed,
heat is transferred from the base to the other
parts, bringing the vessel to a uniform
temperature (which in due course cools to the
temperature of the surroundings). The process
cannot be reversed; a part of the vessel will not
get cooler spontaneously and warm up the base.
It will violate the Second Law of Thermodynamics,
if it did. The free expansion of a gas is irreversible.
The combustion reaction of a mixture of petrol
and air ignited by a spark cannot be reversed.
Cooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the
kitchen diffuses to the entire room. The diffusion
process will not spontaneously reverse and bring
the gas back to the cylinder. The stirring of a
liquid in thermal contact with a reservoir will
convert the work done into heat, increasing the
internal energy of the reservoir. The process
cannot be reversed exactly; otherwise it would
amount to conversion of heat entirely into work,
violating the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
Irreversibility is a rule rather an exception
in nature.
Irreversibility arises mainly from two causes:
one, many processes (like a free expansion, or
an explosive chemical reaction) take the system
to non-equilibrium states; two, most processes
involve friction, viscosity and other dissipative
effects (e.g., a moving body coming to a stop and
losing its mechanical energy as heat to the floor
and the body; a rotating blade in a liquid coming
to a stop due to viscosity and losing its
mechanical energy with corresponding gain in
the internal energy of the liquid). Since
dissipative effects are present everywhere and
can be minimised but not fully eliminated, most
processes that we deal with are irreversible.



THERMODYNAMICS

237

A thermodynamic process (state i → state f )
is reversible if the process can be turned back
such that both the system and the surroundings
return to their original states, with no other
change anywhere else in the universe. From the
preceding discussion, a reversible process is an
idealised notion. A process is reversible only if
it is quasi-static (system in equilibrium with the
surroundings at every stage) and there are no
dissipative effects. For example, a quasi-static
isothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a
cylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston
is a reversible process.
Why is reversibility such a basic concept in
thermodynamics ? As we have seen, one of the
concerns of thermodynamics is the efficiency
with which heat can be converted into work.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics rules out
the possibility of a perfect heat engine with 100%
efficiency. But what is the highest efficiency
possible for a heat engine working between two
reservoirs at temperatures T1 and T2 ? It turns
out that a heat engine based on idealised
reversible processes achieves the highest
efficiency possible. All other engines involving
irreversibility in any way (as would be the case
for practical engines) have lower than this
limiting efficiency.
11.11 CARNOT ENGINE

in a reversible heat engine operating between
two temperatures, heat should be absorbed
(from the hot reservoir) isothermally and
released (to the cold reservoir) isothermally. We
thus have identified two steps of the reversible
heat engine : isothermal process at temperature
T1 absorbing heat Q1 from the hot reservoir, and
another isothermal process at temperature T2
releasing heat Q 2 to the cold reservoir. To
complete a cycle, we need to take the system
from temperature T1 to T2 and then back from
temperature T2 to T1. Which processes should
we employ for this purpose that are reversible?
A little reflection shows that we can only adopt
reversible adiabatic processes for these
purposes, which involve no heat flow from any
reservoir. If we employ any other process that is
not adiabatic, say an isochoric process, to take
the system from one temperature to another, we
shall need a series of reservoirs in the
temperature range T2 to T1 to ensure that at each
stage the process is quasi-static. (Remember
again that for a process to be quasi-static and
reversible, there should be no finite temperature
difference between the system and the reservoir.)
But we are considering a reversible engine that
operates between only two temperatures. Thus
adiabatic processes must bring about the
temperature change in the system from T1 to T2
and T2 to T1 in this engine.

Suppose we have a hot reservoir at temperature
T1 and a cold reservoir at temperature T2. What
is the maximum efficiency possible for a heat
engine operating between the two reservoirs and
what cycle of processes should be adopted to
achieve the maximum efficiency ? Sadi Carnot,
a French engineer, first considered this question
in 1824. Interestingly, Carnot arrived at the
correct answer, even though the basic concepts
of heat and thermodynamics had yet to be firmly
established.
We expect the ideal engine operating between
two temperatures to be a reversible engine.
Irreversibility is associated with dissipative
effects, as remarked in the preceding section,
and lowers efficiency. A process is reversible if
it is quasi-static and non-dissipative. We have
seen that a process is not quasi-static if it
involves finite temperature difference between
the system and the reservoir. This implies that

A reversible heat engine operating between

have just argued that such an engine must have

We have already seen that a Carnot engine
is a reversible engine. Indeed it is the only
reversible engine possible that works between
two reservoirs at different temperatures. Each
step of the Carnot cycle given in Fig. 11.9 can
be reversed. This will amount to taking heat Q2
from the cold reservoir at T2, doing work W on
the system, and transferring heat Q1 to the hot
reservoir. This will be a reversible refrigerator.
We next establish the important result
(sometimes called Carnot’s theorem) that
(a) working between two given temperatures T1
and T2 of the hot and cold reservoirs respectively,
no engine can have efficiency more than that of
the Carnot engine and (b) the efficiency of the
Carnot engine is independent of the nature of
the working substance.

To prove the result (a), imagine a reversible
(Carnot) engine R and an irreversible engine I
working between the same source (hot reservoir)
and sink (cold reservoir). Let us couple the
engines, I and R, in such a way so that I acts
like a heat engine and R acts as a refrigerator.
Let I absorb heat Q1 from the source, deliver
work W ′ and release the heat Q1- W′ to the sink.
We arrange so that R returns the same heat Q1
to the source, taking heat Q2 from the sink and
requiring work W = Q1 – Q2 to be done on it.
Now suppose ηR < ηI i.e. if R were to act
as an engine it would give less work output

R

reservoir and delivers the same amount of work
in one cycle, without any change in the source
or anywhere else. This is clearly against the
Kelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law of
Thermodynamics. Hence the assertion ηI > ηR
is wrong. No engine can have efficiency greater
than that of the Carnot engine. A similar
argument can be constructed to show that a
reversible engine with one particular substance
cannot be more efficient than the one using
another substance. The maximum efficiency of
a Carnot engine given by Eq. (11.27) is
independent of the nature of the system
performing the Carnot cycle of operations. Thus
we are justified in using an ideal gas as a system
in the calculation of efficiency η of a Carnot
engine. The ideal gas has a simple equation of
state, which allows us to readily calculate η, but
the final result for η, [Eq. (11.27)], is true for
any Carnot engine.

than that of I i.e. W < W ′ for a given Q1. With R
acting like a refrigerator, this would mean
Q2 = Q1 – W > Q1 – W ′. Thus, on the whole,
the coupled I-R system extracts heat

is a universal relation independent of the nature
of the system. Here Q1 and Q2 are respectively,
the heat absorbed and released isothermally
(from the hot and to the cold reservoirs) in a
Carnot engine. Equation (11.28), can, therefore,
be used as a relation to define a truly universal
thermodynamic temperature scale that is
independent of any particular properties of the
system used in the Carnot cycle. Of course, for
an ideal gas as a working substance, this
universal temperature is the same as the ideal
gas temperature introduced in section 11.9.

SUMMARY
1.

2.

(11.28)

The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that ‘two systems in thermal equilibrium with a
third system separately are in thermal equilibrium with each other’. The Zeroth Law leads
to the concept of temperature.
Internal energy of a system is the sum of kinetic energies and potential energies of the
molecular constituents of the system. It does not include the over-all kinetic energy of
the system. Heat and work are two modes of energy transfer to the system. Heat is the
energy transfer arising due to temperature difference between the system and the
surroundings. Work is energy transfer brought about by other means, such as moving
the piston of a cylinder containing the gas, by raising or lowering some weight connected
to it.

PHYSICS

3.

The first law of thermodynamics is the general law of conservation of energy applied to
any system in which energy transfer from or to the surroundings (through heat and
work) is taken into account. It states that
∆Q = ∆U + ∆W
where ∆Q is the heat supplied to the system, ∆W is the work done by the system and ∆U
is the change in internal energy of the system.

4.

The specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by

s=

1 ∆Q
m ∆T

where m is the mass of the substance and ∆Q is the heat required to change its
temperature by ∆T. The molar specific heat capacity of a substance is defined by

C=

1 ∆Q
µ ∆T

where µ is the number of moles of the substance. For a solid, the law of equipartition
of energy gives
C = 3R
which generally agrees with experiment at ordinary temperatures.
Calorie is the old unit of heat. 1 calorie is the amount of heat required to raise the
temperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 °C to 15.5 °C. 1 cal = 4.186 J.
5.

For an ideal gas, the molar specific heat capacities at constant pressure and volume
satisfy the relation
Cp – Cv = R

6.

Equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system are described by state variables. The
value of a state variable depends only on the particular state, not on the path used to
arrive at that state. Examples of state variables are pressure (P ), volume (V ), temperature
(T ), and mass (m ). Heat and work are not state variables. An Equation of State (like
the ideal gas equation PV = µ RT ) is a relation connecting different state variables.

7.

A quasi-static process is an infinitely slow process such that the system remains in
thermal and mechanical equilibrium with the surroundings throughout. In a
quasi-static process, the pressure and temperature of the environment can differ from
those of the system only infinitesimally.

8.

In an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas from volume V1 to V2 at temperature T the
heat absorbed (Q) equals the work done (W ) by the gas, each given by

Clausius statement
No process is possible whose sole result is the transfer of heat from a colder object to a

Temperature of a body is related to its average internal energy, not to the kinetic energy
of motion of its centre of mass. A bullet fired from a gun is not at a higher temperature
because of its high speed.
Equilibrium in thermodynamics refers to the situation when macroscopic variables
describing the thermodynamic state of a system do not depend on time. Equilibrium of
a system in mechanics means the net external force and torque on the system are zero.

In a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, the microscopic constituents of a system are
not in equilibrium (in the sense of mechanics).
Heat capacity, in general, depends on the process the system goes through when heat is
supplied.
In isothermal quasi-static processes, heat is absorbed or given out by the system even
though at every stage the gas has the same temperature as that of the surrounding
reservoir. This is possible because of the infinitesimal difference in temperature between
the system and the reservoir.

Boyle discovered the law named after him in 1661. Boyle,
Newton and several others tried to explain the behaviour of
gases by considering that gases are made up of tiny atomic
particles. The actual atomic theory got established more than
150 years later. Kinetic theory explains the behaviour of gases
based on the idea that the gas consists of rapidly moving
atoms or molecules. This is possible as the inter-atomic forces,
which are short range forces that are important for solids
and liquids, can be neglected for gases. The kinetic theory
was developed in the nineteenth century by Maxwell,

gives a molecular interpretation of pressure and temperature
of a gas, and is consistent with gas laws and Avogadro’s
hypothesis. It correctly explains specific heat capacities of
many gases. It also relates measurable properties of gases
such as viscosity, conduction and diffusion with molecular
parameters, yielding estimates of molecular sizes and masses.
This chapter gives an introduction to kinetic theory.
12.2 MOLECULAR NATURE OF MATTER
Richard Feynman, one of the great physicists of 20th century
considers the discovery that “Matter is made up of atoms” to
be a very significant one. Humanity may suffer annihilation
(due to nuclear catastrophe) or extinction (due to
environmental disasters) if we do not act wisely. If that
happens, and all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed
then Feynman would like the ‘Atomic Hypothesis’ to be
communicated to the next generation of creatures in the
universe. Atomic Hypothesis: All things are made of atoms little particles that move around in perpetual motion,
attracting each other when they are a little distance apart,
but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.
Speculation that matter may not be continuous, existed in
many places and cultures. Kanada in India and Democritus

Atomic Hypothesis in Ancient India and Greece
Though John Dalton is credited with the introduction of atomic viewpoint in modern science, scholars in
ancient India and Greece conjectured long before the existence of atoms and molecules. In the Vaiseshika
school of thought in India founded by Kanada (Sixth century B.C.) the atomic picture was developed in
considerable detail. Atoms were thought to be eternal, indivisible, infinitesimal and ultimate parts of matter.
It was argued that if matter could be subdivided without an end, there would be no difference between a
mustard seed and the Meru mountain. The four kinds of atoms (Paramanu — Sanskrit word for the
smallest particle) postulated were Bhoomi (Earth), Ap (water), Tejas (fire) and Vayu (air) that have characteristic
mass and other attributes, were propounded. Akasa (space) was thought to have no atomic structure and
was continuous and inert. Atoms combine to form different molecules (e.g. two atoms combine to form a
diatomic molecule dvyanuka, three atoms form a tryanuka or a triatomic molecule), their properties depending
upon the nature and ratio of the constituent atoms. The size of the atoms was also estimated, by conjecture
or by methods that are not known to us. The estimates vary. In Lalitavistara, a famous biography of the
Buddha written mainly in the second century B.C., the estimate is close to the modern estimate of atomic
size, of the order of 10 –10 m.
In ancient Greece, Democritus (Fourth century B.C.) is best known for his atomic hypothesis. The
word ‘atom’ means ‘indivisible’ in Greek. According to him, atoms differ from each other physically, in
shape, size and other properties and this resulted in the different properties of the substances formed
by their combination. The atoms of water were smooth and round and unable to ‘hook’ on to each
other, which is why liquid /water flows easily. The atoms of earth were rough and jagged, so they held
together to form hard substances. The atoms of fire were thorny which is why it caused painful burns.
These fascinating ideas, despite their ingenuity, could not evolve much further, perhaps because they
were intuitive conjectures and speculations not tested and modified by quantitative experiments - the
hallmark of modern science.

in Greece had suggested that matter may consist
of indivisible constituents. The scientific ‘Atomic
Theory’ is usually credited to John Dalton. He
proposed the atomic theory to explain the laws
of definite and multiple proportions obeyed by
elements when they combine into compounds.
The first law says that any given compound has,
a fixed proportion by mass of its constituents.
The second law says that when two elements
form more than one compound, for a fixed mass
of one element, the masses of the other elements
are in ratio of small integers.
To explain the laws Dalton suggested, about
200 years ago, that the smallest constituents
of an element are atoms. Atoms of one element
are identical but differ from those of other
elements. A small number of atoms of each
element combine to form a molecule of the
compound. Gay Lussac’s law, also given in early
19th century, states: When gases combine
chemically to yield another gas, their volumes
are in the ratios of small integers. Avogadro’s
law (or hypothesis) says: Equal volumes of all
gases at equal temperature and pressure have
the same number of molecules. Avogadro’s law,
when combined with Dalton’s theory explains
Gay Lussac’s law. Since the elements are often
in the form of molecules, Dalton’s atomic theory
can also be referred to as the molecular theory

of matter. The theory is now well accepted by
scientists. However even at the end of the
nineteenth century there were famous scientists
who did not believe in atomic theory !
From many observations, in recent times we
now know that molecules (made up of one or
more atoms) constitute matter. Electron
microscopes
and scanning tunnelling
microscopes enable us to even see them. The
size of an atom is about an angstrom (10 -10 m).
In solids, which are tightly packed, atoms are
spaced about a few angstroms (2 Å) apart. In
liquids the separation between atoms is also
about the same. In liquids the atoms are not
as rigidly fixed as in solids, and can move
around. This enables a liquid to flow. In gases
the interatomic distances are in tens of
angstroms. The average distance a molecule
can travel without colliding is called the mean
free path. The mean free path, in gases, is of
the order of thousands of angstroms. The atoms
are much freer in gases and can travel long
distances without colliding. If they are not
enclosed, gases disperse away. In solids and
liquids the closeness makes the interatomic force
important. The force has a long range attraction
and a short range repulsion. The atoms attract
when they are at a few angstroms but repel when
they come closer. The static appearance of a gas

temperature in kelvin or (absolute) scale. K is a
constant for the given sample but varies with
the volume of the gas. If we now bring in the
idea of atoms or molecules, then K is proportional
to the number of molecules, (say) N in the
sample. We can write K = N k . Observation tells
us that this k is same for all gases. It is called
Boltzmann constant and is denoted by k .

Properties of gases are easier to understand than
those of solids and liquids. This is mainly
because in a gas, molecules are far from each
other and their mutual interactions are
negligible except when two molecules collide.

any gas is equal to its molecular weight in grams
at S.T.P (standard temperature 273 K and
pressure 1 atm). This amount of substance is
called a mole (see Chapter 1 for a more precise
definition). Avogadro had guessed the equality of
numbers in equal volumes of gas at a fixed
temperature and pressure from chemical
reactions. Kinetic theory justifies this hypothesis.
The perfect gas equation can be written as

equilibrium is a dynamic one. In dynamic
equilibrium, molecules collide and change their
speeds during the collision. Only the average
properties are constant.
Atomic theory is not the end of our quest, but
the beginning. We now know that atoms are not
indivisible or elementary. They consist of a
nucleus and electrons. The nucleus itself is made
up of protons and neutrons. The protons and
neutrons are again made up of quarks. Even
quarks may not be the end of the story. There
may be string like elementary entities. Nature
always has surprises for us, but the search for
truth is often enjoyable and the discoveries
beautiful. In this chapter, we shall limit ourselves
to understanding the behaviour of gases (and a
little bit of solids), as a collection of moving
molecules in incessant motion.

A gas that satisfies Eq. (12.3) exactly at all
pressures and temperatures is defined to be an
ideal gas. An ideal gas is a simple theoretical
model of a gas. No real gas is truly ideal.
Fig. 12.1 shows departures from ideal gas
behaviour for a real gas at three different
temperatures. Notice that all curves approach
the ideal gas behaviour for low pressures and
high temperatures.
At low pressures or high temperatures the
molecules are far apart and molecular
interactions are negligible. Without interactions
the gas behaves like an ideal one.
If we fix µ and T in Eq. (12.3), we get
PV = constant
(12.6)
i.e., keeping temperature constant, pressure of
a given mass of gas varies inversely with volume.
This is the famous Boyle’s law. Fig. 12.2 shows
comparison between experimental P-V curves
and the theoretical curves predicted by Boyle’s
law. Once again you see that the agreement is
good at high temperatures and low pressures.
Next, if you fix P, Eq. (12.1) shows that V ∝ T i.e.,
for a fixed pressure, the volume of a gas is
proportional to its absolute temperature T

Clearly P1 = µ1 R T/V is the pressure that

gas. Thus, the total pressure of a mixture of ideal
gases is the sum of partial pressures. This is
Dalton’s law of partial pressures.

PHYSICS

Answer For a given mass of water molecules,
the density is less if volume is large. So the
volume of the vapour is 1000/0.6 = 1/(6 × 10 -4 )
times larger. If densities of bulk water and water
molecules are same, then the fraction of
molecular volume to the total volume in liquid
state is 1. As volume in vapour state has
increased, the fractional volume is less by the
same amount, i.e. 6×10-4.
⊳
Example 12.2 Estimate the volume of a
water molecule using the data in Example
12.1.

⊳

Answer In the liquid (or solid) phase, the
molecules of water are quite closely packed. The
density of water molecule may therefore, be
regarded as roughly equal to the density of bulk
water = 1000 kg m–3. To estimate the volume of
a water molecule, we need to know the mass of
a single water molecule. We know that 1 mole
of water has a mass approximately equal to
(2 + 16)g = 18 g = 0.018 kg.
Since 1 mole contains about 6 × 1023
molecules (Avogadro’s number), the mass of
a molecule of water is (0.018)/(6 × 1023) kg =
3 × 10–26 kg. Therefore, a rough estimate of the
volume of a water molecule is as follows :
Volume of a water molecule
= (3 × 10–26 kg)/ (1000 kg m–3)
= 3 × 10–29 m3
= (4/3) π (Radius)3
Hence, Radius ≈ 2 ×10-10 m = 2 Å
⊳
Example 12.3
What is the average
distance between atoms (interatomic
distance) in water? Use the data given in
Examples 12.1 and 12.2.

⊳

Answer : A given mass of water in vapour state
has 1.67×103 times the volume of the same mass
of water in liquid state (Ex. 12.1). This is also
the increase in the amount of volume available
for each molecule of water. When volume
increases by 103 times the radius increases by
V1/3 or 10 times, i.e., 10 × 2 Å = 20 Å. So the
average distance is 2 × 20 = 40 Å.

Example 12.4 A vessel contains two nonreactive gases : neon (monatomic) and
oxygen (diatomic). The ratio of their partial

number of molecules and (ii) mass density
of neon and oxygen in the vessel. Atomic
mass of Ne = 20.2 u, molecular mass of O2
= 32.0 u.

Answer Partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is
the pressure it would have for the same volume
and temperature if it alone occupied the vessel.
(The total pressure of a mixture of non-reactive
gases is the sum of partial pressures due to its
constituent gases.) Each gas (assumed ideal)
obeys the gas law. Since V and T are common to
the two gases, we have P1V = µ 1 RT and P2V =
µ2 RT, i.e. (P1/P2) = (µ1 / µ2). Here 1 and 2 refer
to neon and oxygen respectively. Since (P1/P2) =
(3/2) (given), (µ1/ µ2) = 3/2.
(i) By definition µ1 = (N1/NA ) and µ2 = (N2/NA)
where N1 and N2 are the number of molecules
of 1 and 2, and NA is the Avogadro’s number.
Therefore, (N1/N2) = (µ1 / µ2) = 3/2.
(ii) We can also write µ1 = (m1/M1) and µ2 =
(m2/M2) where m1 and m2 are the masses of
1 and 2; and M1 and M2 are their molecular
masses. (Both m1 and M1; as well as m2 and
M2 should be expressed in the same units).

12.4 KINETIC THEORY OF AN IDEAL GAS
Kinetic theory of gases is based on the molecular
picture of matter. A given amount of gas is a
collection of a large number of molecules
(typically of the order of Avogadro’s number) that
are in incessant random motion. At ordinary
pressure and temperature, the average distance
between molecules is a factor of 10 or more than
the typical size of a molecule (2 Å). Thus,
interaction between molecules is negligible and
we can assume that they move freely in straight
lines according to Newton’s first law. However,
occasionally, they come close to each other,
experience intermolecular forces and their
velocities change. These interactions are called
collisions. The molecules collide incessantly
against each other or with the walls and change



⊳

KINETIC THEORY

249

their velocities. The collisions are considered to
be elastic. We can derive an expression for the
pressure of a gas based on the kinetic theory.
We begin with the idea that molecules of a
gas are in incessant random motion, colliding
against one another and with the walls of the
container. All collisions between molecules
among themselves or between molecules and the
walls are elastic. This implies that total kinetic
energy is conserved. The total momentum is
conserved as usual.
12.4.1 Pressure of an Ideal Gas
Consider a gas enclosed in a cube of side l. Take
the axes to be parallel to the sides of the cube,
as shown in Fig. 12.4. A molecule with velocity
(vx, vy, vz ) hits the planar wall parallel to yzplane of area A (= l 2). Since the collision is elastic,
the molecule rebounds with the same velocity;
its y and z components of velocity do not change
in the collision but the x-component reverses
sign. That is, the velocity after collision is
(-vx, vy, vz ) . The change in momentum of the
molecule is: –mvx – (mvx) = – 2mvx . By the
principle of conservation of momentum, the
momentum imparted to the wall in the collision
= 2mvx .

the wall. Thus, the number of molecules with
velocity (vx, vy, vz ) hitting the wall in time ∆t is
½A vx ∆t n, where n is the number of molecules
per unit volume. The total momentum
transferred to the wall by these molecules in
time ∆t is :
Q = (2mvx) (½ n A vx ∆t )
(12.10)
The force on the wall is the rate of momentum
transfer Q/∆t and pressure is force per unit
area :
P = Q /(A ∆t) = n m vx2
(12.11)
Actually, all molecules in a gas do not have
the same velocity; there is a distribution in
velocities. The above equation, therefore, stands
for pressure due to the group of molecules with
speed vx in the x-direction and n stands for the
number density of that group of molecules. The
total pressure is obtained by summing over the
contribution due to all groups:
P = n m v x2
(12.12)
where v 2x is the average of vx2 . Now the gas
is isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction
of velocity of the molecules in the vessel.
Therefore, by symmetry,
2
v 2x = vy = v z2

= (1/3) [ v 2x + v y2 + v z2 ] = (1/3) v 2

(12.13)

where v is the speed and v 2 denotes the mean
of the squared speed. Thus
P = (1/3) n m v 2

Fig. 12.4

Elastic collision of a gas molecule with the
wall of the container.

To calculate the force (and pressure) on the
wall, we need to calculate momentum imparted
to the wall per unit time. In a small time interval
∆t, a molecule with x-component of velocity vx
will hit the wall if it is within the distance vx ∆t
from the wall. That is, all molecules within the
volume Avx ∆t only can hit the wall in time ∆t.
But, on the average, half of these are moving
towards the wall and the other half away from

(12.14)

Some remarks on this derivation. First,
though we choose the container to be a cube,
the shape of the vessel really is immaterial. For
a vessel of arbitrary shape, we can always choose
a small infinitesimal (planar) area and carry
through the steps above. Notice that both A and
∆t do not appear in the final result. By Pascal’s
law, given in Ch. 9, pressure in one portion of
the gas in equilibrium is the same as anywhere
else. Second, we have ignored any collisions in
the derivation. Though this assumption is
difficult to justify rigorously, we can qualitatively
see that it will not lead to erroneous results. The
number of molecules hitting the wall in time ∆t
was found to be ½ n Avx ∆t. Now the collisions
are random and the gas is in a steady state.
Thus, if a molecule with velocity (vx, vy, vz )
acquires a different velocity due to collision with
some molecule, there will always be some other



250

PHYSICS

molecule with a different initial velocity which
after a collision acquires the velocity (vx, vy, vz ).
If this were not so, the distribution of velocities
would not remain steady. In any case we are
finding v x2 . Thus, on the whole, molecular
collisions (if they are not too frequent and the
time spent in a collision is negligible compared
to time between collisions) will not affect the
calculation above.
12.4.2 Kinetic Interpretation of Temperature
Equation (13.14) can be written as
PV = (1/3) nV m v 2

(12.15a)

(12.15b)
PV = (2/3) N x ½ m v
where N (= nV ) is the number of molecules in
the sample.
The quantity in the bracket is the average
translational kinetic energy of the molecules in
the gas. Since the internal energy E of an ideal
gas is purely kinetic*,
(12.16)
E = N × (1/2) m v 2

(12.20)
P = (1/3) [n1m1 v12 + n2 m2 v 22 +… ]
In equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of
the molecules of different gases will be equal.
That is,
½ m1 v12 = ½ m2 v 22 = (3/2) kB T
so that
P = (n1 + n2 +… ) kB T

which is Dalton’s law of partial pressures.
From Eq. (12.19), we can get an idea of the
typical speed of molecules in a gas. At a
temperature T = 300 K, the mean square speed
of a molecule in nitrogen gas is :

2

m =

M N2
NA

=

28
= 4.65 × 10 –26 kg.
6.02 × 1026

v 2 = 3 kB T / m = (516)2 m2s-2
The square root of v 2 is known as root mean
square (rms) speed and is denoted by vrms,
( We can also write v 2 as < v2 >.)
vrms = 516 m s-1
The speed is of the order of the speed of sound
in air. It follows from Eq. (12.19) that at the same
temperature, lighter molecules have greater rms
speed.

⊳

Equation (12.15) then gives :
PV = (2/3) E
(12.17)
We are now ready for a kinetic interpretation
of temperature. Combining Eq. (12.17) with the
ideal gas Eq. (12.3), we get
E = (3/2) kB NT
(12.18)
2
or E/ N = ½ m v
= (3/2) kBT
(12.19)
i.e., the average kinetic energy of a molecule is
proportional to the absolute temperature of the
gas; it is independent of pressure, volume or
the nature of the ideal gas. This is a fundamental
result relating temperature, a macroscopic
measurable
parameter
of
a
gas
(a thermodynamic variable as it is called) to a
molecular quantity, namely the average kinetic
energy of a molecule. The two domains are
connected by the Boltzmann constant. We note
in passing that Eq. (12.18) tells us that internal
energy of an ideal gas depends only on
temperature, not on pressure or volume. With
this interpretation of temperature, kinetic theory
of an ideal gas is completely consistent with the
ideal gas equation and the various gas laws
based on it.
For a mixture of non-reactive ideal gases, the
total pressure gets contribution from each gas
in the mixture. Equation (12.14) becomes

(12.21)

Example 12.5 A flask contains argon and
chlorine in the ratio of 2:1 by mass. The
temperature of the mixture is 27 °C. Obtain
the ratio of (i) average kinetic energy per
molecule, and (ii) root mean square speed
v rms of the molecules of the two gases.
Atomic mass of argon = 39.9 u; Molecular
mass of chlorine = 70.9 u.

Answer The important point to remember is that
the average kinetic energy (per molecule) of any
(ideal) gas (be it monatomic like argon, diatomic
like chlorine or polyatomic) is always equal to
(3/2) kBT. It depends only on temperature, and
is independent of the nature of the gas.
(i) Since argon and chlorine both have the same
temperature in the flask, the ratio of average
kinetic energy (per molecule) of the two gases
is 1:1.
(ii) Now ½ m vrms2 = average kinetic energy per
molecule = (3/2) ) kBT where m is the mass

freedom also. See section 12.5.

Answer At a fixed temperature the average
energy = ½ m <v2 > is constant. So smaller the
mass of the molecule, faster will be the speed.
The ratio of speeds is inversely proportional to
the square root of the ratio of the masses. The
masses are 349 and 352 units. So
v349 / v352 = ( 352/ 349)1/2 = 1.0044 .

To separate it from the more abundant isotope

U, the mixture is surrounded by a porous
cylinder. The porous cylinder must be thick and
narrow, so that the molecule wanders through
individually, colliding with the walls of the long
pore. The faster molecule will leak out more than
the slower one and so there is more of the lighter
molecule (enrichment) outside the porous
cylinder (Fig. 12.5). The method is not very
efficient and has to be repeated several times
for sufficient enrichment.].

When gases diffuse, their rate of diffusion is
inversely proportional to square root of the
masses (see Exercise 12.12 ). Can you guess the
explanation from the above answer?

You should note that the composition of the
mixture by mass is quite irrelevant to the above
calculation. Any other proportion by mass of
argon and chlorine would give the same answers
to (i) and (ii), provided the temperature remains
unaltered.

Example 12.7 (a) When a molecule (or an
elastic ball) hits a ( massive) wall, it
rebounds with the same speed. When a ball
hits a massive bat held firmly, the same
thing happens. However, when the bat is
moving towards the ball, the ball rebounds
with a different speed. Does the ball move
faster or slower? (Ch.5 will refresh your
memory on elastic collisions.)
(b) When gas in a cylinder is compressed
by pushing in a piston, its temperature
rises. Guess at an explanation of this in
terms of kinetic theory using (a) above.
(c) What happens when a compressed gas
pushes a piston out and expands. What
would you observe ?
(d) Sachin Tendulkar used a heavy cricket
bat while playing. Did it help him in
anyway ?

Answer (a) Let the speed of the ball be u relative
to the wicket behind the bat. If the bat is moving
towards the ball with a speed V relative to the
wicket, then the relative speed of the ball to bat
is V + u towards the bat. When the ball rebounds
(after hitting the massive bat) its speed, relative
to bat, is V + u moving away from the bat. So
relative to the wicket the speed of the rebounding
ball is V + (V + u) = 2V + u, moving away from the
wicket. So the ball speeds up after the collision
with the bat. The rebound speed will be less than
u if the bat is not massive. For a molecule this
would imply an increase in temperature.

A molecule free to move in space needs three
coordinates to specify its location. If it is
constrained to move in a plane it needs two; and
if constrained to move along a line, it needs just
one coordinate to locate it. This can also be
expressed in another way. We say that it has
one degree of freedom for motion in a line, two
for motion in a plane and three for motion in
space. Motion of a body as a whole from one
point to another is called translation. Thus, a
molecule free to move in space has three
translational degrees of freedom. Each
translational degree of freedom contributes a
term that contains square of some variable of
motion, e.g., ½ mvx2 and similar terms in
vy and vz. In, Eq. (12.24) we see that in thermal
equilibrium, the average of each such term is
½ kBT .
Molecules of a monatomic gas like argon have
only translational degrees of freedom. But what
about a diatomic gas such as O2 or N 2? A
molecule of O2 has three translational degrees
of freedom. But in addition it can also rotate
about its centre of mass. Figure 12.6 shows the
two independent axes of rotation 1 and 2, normal

Fig. 12.6

The two independent axes of rotation of
a diatomic molecule

where ω1 and ω2 are the angular speeds about
the axes 1 and 2 and I1, I2 are the corresponding
moments of inertia. Note that each rotational
degree of freedom contributes a term to the
energy that contains square of a rotational
variable of motion.
We have assumed above that the O2 molecule
is a ‘rigid rotator’, i.e., the molecule does not
vibrate. This assumption, though found to be
true (at moderate temperatures) for O2, is not
always valid. Molecules, like CO, even at
moderate temperatures have a mode of
vibration, i.e., its atoms oscillate along the
interatomic axis like a one-dimensional
oscillator, and contribute a vibrational energy
term εv to the total energy:

1  dy 

 + ky

2
dt
2

ε = εt + εr + εv
(12.26)
where k is the force constant of the oscillator
and y the vibrational co-ordinate.
Once again the vibrational energy terms in
Eq. (12.26) contain squared terms of vibrational
variables of motion y and dy/dt .

* Rotation along the line joining the atoms has very small moment of inertia and does not come into play for
quantum mechanical reasons. See end of section 12.6.



KINETIC THEORY

253

At this point, notice an important feature in
Eq.(12.26). While each translational and
rotational degree of freedom has contributed only
one ‘squared term’ in Eq.(12.26), one vibrational
mode contributes two ‘squared terms’ : kinetic
and potential energies.
Each quadratic term occurring in the
expression for energy is a mode of absorption of
energy by the molecule. We have seen that in
thermal equilibrium at absolute temperature T,
for each translational mode of motion, the
average energy is ½ kBT. The most elegant
principle of classical statistical mechanics (first
proved by Maxwell) states that this is so for each
mode of energy: translational, rotational and
vibrational. That is, in equilibrium, the total
energy is equally distributed in all possible
energy modes, with each mode having an average
energy equal to ½ kBT. This is known as the law
of equipartition of energy. Accordingly, each
translational and rotational degree of freedom
of a molecule contributes ½ kBT to the energy,
while each vibrational frequency contributes
2 × ½ kBT = kBT , since a vibrational mode has
both kinetic and potential energy modes.
The proof of the law of equipartition of energy
is beyond the scope of this book. Here, we shall
apply the law to predict the specific heats of gases
theoretically. Later, we shall also discuss briefly,
the application to specific heat of solids.

Of course, there are discrepancies between
predicted and actual values of specific heats of
several other gases (not shown in the table), such
as Cl2, C2H6 and many other polyatomic gases.
Usually, the experimental values for specific
heats of these gases are greater than the
predicted values as given in Table12.1 suggesting
that the agreement can be improved by including
vibrational modes of motion in the calculation.
The law of equipartition of energy is, thus, well
verified experimentally at ordinary temperatures.

Answer Using the gas law PV = µRT, you can
easily show that 1 mol of any (ideal) gas at
standard temperature (273 K) and pressure
(1 atm = 1.01 × 105 Pa) occupies a volume of 22.4
litres. This universal volume is called molar
volume. Thus the cylinder in this example
contains 2 mol of helium. Further, since helium
is monatomic, its predicted (and observed) molar
specific heat at constant volume, Cv = (3/2) R,
and molar specific heat at constant pressure,
Cp = (3/2) R + R = (5/2) R . Since the volume of
the cylinder is fixed, the heat required is
determined by Cv. Therefore,
Heat required = no. of moles × molar specific heat

= 2 × 1.5 R × 15.0 = 45 R
= 45 × 8.31 = 374 J.
⊳
12.6.4 Specific Heat Capacity of Solids
We can use the law of equipartition of energy to
determine specific heats of solids. Consider a
solid of N atoms, each vibrating about its mean
position. An oscillation in one dimension has
average energy of 2 × ½ kBT = kBT . In three
dimensions, the average energy is 3 kBT. For a
mole of solid, N = N A , and the total
energy is
U = 3 kBT × NA = 3 RT
Now at constant pressure ∆Q = ∆U + P∆V
= ∆U, since for a solid ∆V is negligible. Hence,

amount of heat needed to raise the

As Table 12.3 shows the prediction generally
agrees with experimental values at ordinary
temperature (Carbon is an exception).

by the average relative velocity of the molecules.

As expected, the mean free path given by
Eq. (12.40) depends inversely on the number
density and the size of the molecules. In a highly
evacuated tube n is rather small and the mean
free path can be as large as the length of the
tube.

Suppose the molecules of a gas are spheres of
diameter d. Focus on a single molecule with the
average speed <v>. It will suffer collision with
any molecule that comes within a distance d
between the centres. In time ∆t, it sweeps a
volume πd2 <v> ∆t wherein any other molecule
will collide with it (see Fig. 12.7). If n is the
number of molecules per unit volume, the
molecule suffers nπd2 <v> ∆t collisions in time
∆t. Thus the rate of collisions is nπd2 <v> or the
time between two successive collisions is on the
average,
τ = 1/(nπ <v> d2 )

The average distance between two successive
collisions, called the mean free path l, is :

interatomic distance ~ 40 Å = 4 × 10-9 m calculated
earlier. It is this large value of mean free path that
leads to the typical gaseous behaviour. Gases can
not be confined without a container.
Using, the kinetic theory of gases, the bulk
measurable properties like viscosity, heat
conductivity and diffusion can be related to the
microscopic parameters like molecular size. It is
through such relations that the molecular sizes

constants.

This tells us that the temperature of a gas is a measure of the average kinetic energy of
a molecule, independent of the nature of the gas or molecule. In a mixture of gases at a

The law of equipartition of energy states that if a system is in equilibrium at absolute
temperature T, the total energy is distributed equally in different energy modes of
absorption, the energy in each mode being equal to ½ kB T. Each translational and
rotational degree of freedom corresponds to one energy mode of absorption and has
energy ½ kB T. Each vibrational frequency has two modes of energy (kinetic and potential)
with corresponding energy equal to
2 × ½ kB T = kB T.

5.

Using the law of equipartition of energy, the molar specific heats of gases can be
determined and the values are in agreement with the experimental values of specific
heats of several gases. The agreement can be improved by including vibrational modes
of motion.

POINTS TO PONDER
1.

Pressure of a fluid is not only exerted on the wall. Pressure exists everywhere in a fluid.
Any layer of gas inside the volume of a container is in equilibrium because the pressure
is the same on both sides of the layer.

2.

We should not have an exaggerated idea of the intermolecular distance in a gas. At
ordinary pressures and temperatures, this is only 10 times or so the interatomic distance
in solids and liquids. What is different is the mean free path which in a gas is 100 times
the interatomic distance and 1000 times the size of the molecule.

3.

The law of equipartition of energy is stated thus: the energy for each degree of freedom
in thermal equilibrium is ½ k T. Each quadratic term in the total energy expression of
B
a molecule is to be counted as a degree of freedom. Thus, each vibrational mode gives 2
(not 1) degrees of freedom (kinetic and potential energy modes), corresponding to the
energy 2 × ½ k T = k T.

Molecules of air in a room do not all fall and settle on the ground (due to gravity)
because of their high speeds and incessant collisions. In equilibrium, there is a very
slight increase in density at lower heights (like in the atmosphere). The effect is small
since the potential energy (mgh) for ordinary heights is much less than the average
kinetic energy ½ mv2 of the molecules.
< v2 > is not always equal to ( < v >)2. The average of a squared quantity is not necessarily
the square of the average. Can you find examples for this statement.

INTRODUCTION

In our daily life we come across various kinds of motions.
You have already learnt about some of them, e.g., rectilinear
motion and motion of a projectile. Both these motions are
non-repetitive. We have also learnt about uniform circular
motion and orbital motion of planets in the solar system. In
these cases, the motion is repeated after a certain interval of
time, that is, it is periodic. In your childhood, you must have
enjoyed rocking in a cradle or swinging on a swing. Both
these motions are repetitive in nature but different from the
periodic motion of a planet. Here, the object moves to and fro
about a mean position. The pendulum of a wall clock executes
a similar motion. Examples of such periodic to and fro
motion abound: a boat tossing up and down in a river, the
piston in a steam engine going back and forth, etc. Such a
motion is termed as oscillatory motion. In this chapter we
study this motion.
The study of oscillatory motion is basic to physics; its
concepts are required for the understanding of many physical
phenomena. In musical instruments, like the sitar, the guitar
or the violin, we come across vibrating strings that produce
pleasing sounds. The membranes in drums and diaphragms
in telephone and speaker systems vibrate to and fro about
their mean positions. The vibrations of air molecules make
the propagation of sound possible. In a solid, the atoms vibrate
about their equilibrium positions, the average energy of
vibrations being proportional to temperature. AC power
supply give voltage that oscillates alternately going positive
and negative about the mean value (zero).
The description of a periodic motion, in general, and
oscillatory motion, in particular, requires some fundamental
concepts, like period, frequency, displacement, amplitude
and phase. These concepts are developed in the next section.

PERIODIC AND OSCILLATORY MOTIONS

Fig. 13.1 shows some periodic motions. Suppose
an insect climbs up a ramp and falls down, it
comes back to the initial point and repeats the
process identically. If you draw a graph of its
height above the ground versus time, it would
look something like Fig. 13.1 (a). If a child climbs
up a step, comes down, and repeats the process
identically, its height above the ground would
look like that in Fig. 13.1 (b). When you play the
game of bouncing a ball off the ground, between
your palm and the ground, its height versus time
graph would look like the one in Fig. 13.1 (c).
Note that both the curved parts in Fig. 13.1 (c)
are sections of a parabola given by the Newton’s
equation of motion (see section 2.6),

h = ut +

1 2
gt for downward motion, and
2

1 2
gt for upward motion,

with different values of u in each case. These
are examples of periodic motion. Thus, a motion
that repeats itself at regular intervals of time is
called periodic motion.

h = ut –

Fig. 13.1 Examples of periodic motion. The period T
is shown in each case.

Very often, the body undergoing periodic
motion has an equilibrium position somewhere
inside its path. When the body is at this position
no net external force acts on it. Therefore, if it is
left there at rest, it remains there forever. If the
body is given a small displacement from the
position, a force comes into play which tries to
bring the body back to the equilibrium point,
giving rise to oscillations or vibrations. For
example, a ball placed in a bowl will be in
equilibrium at the bottom. If displaced a little
from the point, it will perform oscillations in the
bowl. Every oscillatory motion is periodic, but
every periodic motion need not be oscillatory.
Circular motion is a periodic motion, but it is
not oscillatory.
There is no significant difference between
oscillations and vibrations. It seems that when
the frequency is small, we call it oscillation (like,
the oscillation of a branch of a tree), while when
the frequency is high, we call it vibration (like,
the vibration of a string of a musical instrument).
Simple harmonic motion is the simplest form
of oscillatory motion. This motion arises when
the force on the oscillating body is directly
proportional to its displacement from the mean
position, which is also the equilibrium position.
Further, at any point in its oscillation, this force
is directed towards the mean position.
In practice, oscillating bodies eventually
come to rest at their equilibrium positions
because of the damping due to friction and other
dissipative causes. However, they can be forced
to remain oscillating by means of some external
periodic agency. We discuss the phenomena of
damped and forced oscillations later in the
chapter.
Any material medium can be pictured as a
collection of a large number of coupled
oscillators. The collective oscillations of the
constituents of a medium manifest themselves
as waves. Examples of waves include water
waves, seismic waves, electromagnetic waves.
We shall study the wave phenomenon in the next
chapter.
13.2.1 Period and frequency
We have seen that any motion that repeats itself
at regular intervals of time is called periodic
motion. The smallest interval of time after
which the motion is repeated is called its
period. Let us denote the period by the symbol
T. Its SI unit is second. For periodic motions,



OSCILLATIONS

which are either too fast or too slow on the scale
of seconds, other convenient units of time are
used. The period of vibrations of a quartz crystal
is expressed in units of microseconds (10–6 s)
abbreviated as µs. On the other hand, the orbital
period of the planet Mercury is 88 earth days.
The Halley’s comet appears after every 76 years.
The reciprocal of T gives the number of
repetitions that occur per unit time. This
quantity is called the frequency of the periodic
motion. It is represented by the symbol ν. The
relation between ν and T is

ν = 1/T

(13.1)

The unit of ν is thus s–1. After the discoverer of
radio waves, Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857–1894),
a special name has been given to the unit of
frequency. It is called hertz (abbreviated as Hz).

13.2.2 Displacement
In section 3.2, we defined displacement of a
particle as the change in its position vector. In
this chapter, we use the term displacement
in a more general sense. It refers to change
with time of any physical property under
consideration. For example, in case of rectilinear
motion of a steel ball on a surface, the distance
from the starting point as a function of time is
its position displacement. The choice of origin
is a matter of convenience. Consider a block
attached to a spring, the other end of the spring
is fixed to a rigid wall [see Fig.13.2(a)]. Generally,
it is convenient to measure displacement of the
body from its equilibrium position. For an
oscillating simple pendulum, the angle from the
vertical as a function of time may be regarded

motion can be described in terms of
angular displacement θ from the vertical.

in the context of position only. There can be
many other kinds of displacement variables. The
voltage across a capacitor, changing with time
in an A C circuit, is also a displacement variable.
In the same way, pressure variations in time in
the propagation of sound wave, the changing
electric and magnetic fields in a light wave are
examples of displacement in different contexts.
The displacement variable may take both
positive and negative values. In experiments on
oscillations, the displacement is measured for
different times.
The displacement can be represented by a
mathematical function of time. In case of periodic
motion, this function is periodic in time. One of
the simplest periodic functions is given by
f (t) = A cos ωt

(13.3a)

If the argument of this function, ωt, is
increased by an integral multiple of 2π radians,
the value of the function remains the same. The



262

PHYSICS

function f (t ) is then periodic and its period, T,
is given by

T=

2π

(ii)

(13.3b)

ω

Thus, the function f (t) is periodic with period T,
f (t) = f (t+T )
The same result is obviously correct if we
consider a sine function, f (t ) = A sin ωt. Further,
a linear combination of sine and cosine functions
like,
f (t) = A sin ωt + B cos ωt
(13.3c)
is also a periodic function with the same period
T. Taking,
A = D cos φ and B = D sin φ
Eq. (13.3c) can be written as,
f (t) = D sin (ωt + φ ) ,

(13.3d)

Here D and φ are constant given by

 B
D = A 2 + B 2 and φ = tan –1  A 
The great importance of periodic sine and
cosine functions is due to a remarkable result
proved by the French mathematician, Jean
Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830): Any
periodic function can be expressed as a
superposition of sine and cosine functions
of different time periods with suitable
coefficients.
u Example 13.2 Which of the following
functions of time represent (a) periodic and
(b) non-periodic motion? Give the period for
each case of periodic motion [ω is any
positive constant].
(i)
sin ωt + cos ωt
(ii) sin ωt + cos 2 ωt + sin 4 ωt
(iii) e – ωt
(iv) log (ωt)

Answer
(i)

sin ωt + cos ωt is a periodic function, it can
also be written as 2 sin (ωt + π/4).
Now 2 sin (ωt + π/4)= 2 sin (ωt + π/4+2π)
=

2 sin [ω (t + 2π/ω) + π/4]

The periodic time of the function is 2π/ω.

This is an example of a periodic motion. It
can be noted that each term represents a
periodic function with a different angular
frequency. Since period is the least interval
of time after which a function repeats its
value, sin ωt has a period T0= 2π/ω ; cos 2 ωt
has a period π/ω =T0/2; and sin 4 ωt has a
period 2π/4ω = T0/4. The period of the first
term is a multiple of the periods of the last
two terms. Therefore, the smallest interval
of time after which the sum of the three
terms repeats is T0, and thus, the sum is a
periodic function with a period 2π/ω.

(iii) The function e – ω t is not periodic, it
decreases monotonically with increasing
time and tends to zero as t → ∞ and thus,
never repeats its value.
(iv) The
function
log ( ω t)
increases
monotonically with time t. It, therefore,
never repeats its value and is a nonperiodic function. It may be noted that as
t → ∞, log(ωt) diverges to ∞. It, therefore,
cannot represent any kind of physical
displacement.

SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

Consider a particle oscillating back and forth
about the origin of an x-axis between the limits
+A and –A as shown in Fig. 13.3. This oscillatory
motion is said to be simple harmonic if the
displacement x of the particle from the origin
varies with time as :
(13.4)
x (t) = A cos (ω t + φ )

Fig. 13.3 A particle vibrating back and forth about
the origin of x-axis, between the limits +A
and –A.

where A, ω and φ are constants.
Thus, simple harmonic motion (SHM) is not
any periodic motion but one in which
displacement is a sinusoidal function of time.
Fig. 13.4 shows the positions of a particle
executing SHM at discrete value of time, each
interval of time being T/4, where T is the period
of motion. Fig. 13.5 plots the graph of x versus t,
which gives the values of displacement as a
continuous function of time. The quantities A,

any loss of generality]. As the cosine function
of time varies from +1 to –1, the displacement
varies between the extremes A and – A. Two
simple harmonic motions may have same ω
and φ but different amplitudes A and B, as
shown in Fig. 13.7 (a).
While the amplitude A is fixed for a given
SHM, the state of motion (position and velocity)
of the particle at any time t is determined by the

Fig. 13.4 The location of the particle in SHM at the
discrete values t = 0, T/4, T/2, 3T/4, T,
5T/4. The time after which motion repeats
itself is T. T will remain fixed, no matter
what location you choose as the initial (t =
0) location. The speed is maximum for zero
displacement (at x = 0) and zero at the
extremes of motion.

ω and φ which characterize a given SHM have
standard names, as summarised in Fig. 13.6.
Let us understand these quantities.
The amplitutde A of SHM is the magnitude
of maximum displacement of the particle.
[Note, A can be taken to be positive without

argument (ωt + φ) in the cosine function. This
time-dependent quantity, (ωt + φ) is called the
phase of the motion. The value of plase at t = 0
is φ and is called the phase constant (or phase
angle). If the amplitude is known, φ can be
determined from the displacement at t = 0. Two
simple harmonic motions may have the same A
and ω but different phase angle φ, as shown in
Fig. 13.7 (b).
Finally, the quantity ω can be seen to be
related to the period of motion T. Taking, for
simplicity, φ = 0 in Eq. (13.4), we have

x (t + T ). That is,

Now the cosine function is periodic with period
2π, i.e., it first repeats itself when the argument
changes by 2π. Therefore,

ω(t + T ) = ωt + 2π

motion having a period T = 2π/ω and a
phase angle (–π/4) or (7π/4)

The function is periodic having a period
T = π/ω. It also represents a harmonic
motion with the point of equilibrium
occurring at ½ instead of zero.

ω is called the angular frequency of SHM. Its
S.I. unit is radians per second. Since the
frequency of oscillations is simply 1/T, ω is 2π
times the frequency of oscillation. Two simple
harmonic motions may have the same A and φ,
but different ω, as seen in Fig. 13.8. In this plot
the curve (b) has half the period and twice the
frequency of the curve (a).

SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION AND
UNIFORM CIRCULAR MOTION

In this section, we show that the projection of
uniform circular motion on a diameter of the
circle follows simple harmonic motion. A
simple experiment (Fig. 13.9) helps us visualise
this connection. Tie a ball to the end of a string
and make it move in a horizontal plane about
a fixed point with a constant angular speed.
The ball would then perform a uniform circular
motion in the horizontal plane. Observe the
ball sideways or from the front, fixing your
attention in the plane of motion. The ball will
appear to execute to and fro motion along a
horizontal line with the point of rotation as
the midpoint. You could alternatively observe
the shadow of the ball on a wall which is
perpendicular to the plane of the circle. In this
process what we are observing is the motion
of the ball on a diameter of the circle normal
to the direction of viewing.

periods.

mathematically. Suppose a particle P is moving
uniformly on a circle of radius A with angular
speed ω. The sense of rotation is anticlockwise.
The initial position vector of the particle, i.e.,
the vector OP at t = 0 makes an angle of φ with
the positive direction of x-axis. In time t, it will

will make an angle of ω t + φ with the +ve
x-axis. Next, consider the projection of the
position vector OP on the x-axis. This will be
OP′. The position of P′ on the x-axis, as the
particle P moves on the circle, is given by
x(t ) = A cos ( ωt + φ )
which is the defining equation of SHM. This
shows that if P moves uniformly on a circle,
its projection P′ on a diameter of the circle
executes SHM. The particle P and the circle
on which it moves are sometimes referred to
as the reference particle and the reference circle,
respectively.
We can take projection of the motion of P on
any diameter, say the y-axis. In that case, the
displacement y(t) of P′ on the y-axis is given by
y = A sin (ωt + φ )
which is also an SHM of the same amplitude
as that of the projection on x-axis, but differing
by a phase of π/2.
In spite of this connection between circular
motion and SHM, the force acting on a particle
in linear simple harmonic motion is very
different from the centripetal force needed to
keep a particle in uniform circular motion.

At t = 0, OP makes an angle of 45o = π/4 rad

* The natural unit of angle is radian, defined through the ratio of arc to radius. Angle is a dimensionless
quantity. Therefore it is not always necessary to mention the unit ‘radian’ when we use π , its multiples
or submultiples. The conversion between radian and degree is not similar to that between metre and
centimetre or mile. If the argument of a trigonometric function is stated without units, it is understood
that the unit is radian. On the other hand, if degree is to be used as the unit of angle, then it must be
shown explicitly. For example, sin(150) means sine of 15 degree, but sin(15) means sine of 15 radians.
Hereafter, we will often drop ‘rad’ as the unit, and it should be understood that whenever angle is
mentioned as a numerical value, without units, it is to be taken as radians.

where the negative sign shows that v (t) has a
direction opposite to the positive direction of
x-axis. Eq. (13.9) gives the instantaneous

course, obtain this equation without using
geometrical argument, directly by differentiating
(Eq. 13.4) with respect of t:

The method of reference circle can be similarly
used for obtaining instantaneous acceleration
of a particle undergoing SHM. We know that the
centripetal acceleration of a particle P in uniform
circular motion has a magnitude v2/A or ω2A,
and it is directed towards the centre i.e., the
direction is along PO. The instantaneous
acceleration of the projection particle P′ is then

VELOCITY AND ACCELERATION IN
SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION

The speed of a particle v in uniform circular
motion is its angular speed ω times the radius
of the circle A.
v = ωA

(13.8)

The direction of velocity v at a time t is along
the tangent to the circle at the point where the
particle is located at that instant. From the
geometry of Fig. 13.11, it is clear that the velocity
of the projection particle P′ at time t is
v(t ) = –ωA sin (ωt + φ )
(13.9)

Fig. 13.12

The acceleration, a(t), of the particle P′ is
the projection of the acceleration a of the
reference particle P.

Eq. (13.11) gives the acceleration of a particle
in SHM. The same equation can again be
obtained directly by differentiating velocity v(t)
given by Eq. (13.9) with respect to time:

d
(13.12)

We note from Eq. (13.11) the important
property that acceleration of a particle in SHM
is proportional to displacement. For x(t) > 0,
a(t) < 0 and for x(t) < 0, a(t) > 0. Thus, whatever

a(t) is always directed towards the centre.
For simplicity, let us put φ = 0 and write the
expression for x (t), v (t) and a(t)
x(t) = A cos ωt, v(t) = – ω Asin ωt, a(t)=–ω2 A cos ωt
The corresponding plots are shown in Fig. 13.13.
All quantities vary sinusoidally with time; only
their maxima differ and the different plots differ
in phase. x varies between –A to A; v(t) varies
from –ωA to ωA and a(t) from –ω2A to ω2A. With
respect to displacement plot, velocity plot has a
phase difference of π/2 and acceleration plot has
a phase difference of π.

FORCE LAW FOR SIMPLE HARMONIC

Using Newton’s second law of motion, and the
expression for acceleration of a particle
undergoing SHM (Eq. 13.11), the force acting
on a particle of mass m in SHM is
F (t ) = ma

according to the equation (in SI units),
x = 5 cos [2π t + π/4].
At t = 1.5 s, calculate the (a) displacement,
(b) speed and (c) acceleration of the body.

Answer The angular frequency ω of the body

At t = 1.5 s

1.5 s + π/4]

= –3.535 m

Like acceleration, force is always directed
towards the mean position—hence it is sometimes
called the restoring force in SHM. To summarise
the discussion so far, simple harmonic motion can
be defined in two equivalent ways, either by Eq.
(13.4) for displacement or by Eq. (13.13) that gives
its force law. Going from Eq. (13.4) to Eq. (13.13)
required us to differentiate two times. Likewise,
by integrating the force law Eq. (13.13) two times,
we can get back Eq. (13.4).
Note that the force in Eq. (13.13) is linearly
proportional to x(t). A particle oscillating under
such a force is, therefore, calling a linear
harmonic oscillator. In the real world, the force
may contain small additional terms proportional
to x2, x3, etc. These then are called non-linear
oscillators.

Both kinetic and potential energies of a particle
in SHM vary between zero and their maximum
values.
In section 13.5 we have seen that the velocity
of a particle executing SHM, is a periodic
function of time. It is zero at the extreme positions
of displacement. Therefore, the kinetic energy (K)
of such a particle, which is defined as

K=

=

1
m ω 2 A 2 sin 2 (ωt + φ )
2

k A 2 sin2 (ωt + φ )

(13.15)

is also a periodic function of time, being zero
when the displacement is maximum and
maximum when the particle is at the mean
position. Note, since the sign of v is immaterial
in K, the period of K is T/2.
What is the potential energy (U) of a particle
executing simple harmonic motion? In
Chapter 6, we have seen that the concept of
potential energy is possible only for conservative
forces. The spring force F = –kx is a conservative
force, with associated potential energy

U=

k x2
2

(13.16)

Hence the potential energy of a particle
executing simple harmonic motion is,
U(x) =

1
k x2
2

F = –2kx
Hence the force acting on the mass is
proportional to the displacement and is directed
towards the mean position; therefore, the motion
executed by the mass is simple harmonic. The
time period of oscillations is,

Thus, the potential energy of a particle

periodic, with period T/2, being zero at the mean
position and maximum at the extreme
displacements.

It follows from Eqs. (13.15) and (13.17) that
the total energy, E, of the system is,

The total mechanical energy of a harmonic
oscillator is thus independent of time as
expected for motion under any conservative
force. The time and displacement dependence
of the potential and kinetic energies of a
linear simple harmonic oscillator are shown
in Fig. 13.16.

Observe that both kinetic energy and
potential energy in SHM are seen to be always
positive in Fig. 13.16. Kinetic energy can, of
course, be never negative, since it is
proportional to the square of speed. Potential
energy is positive by choice of the undermined
constant in potential energy. Both kinetic
energy and potential energy peak twice during
each period of SHM. For x = 0, the energy is
kinetic; at the extremes x = ±A, it is all
potential energy. In the course of motion
between these limits, kinetic energy increases
at the expense of potential energy or
vice-versa.

13.8 The Simple Pendulum
It is said that Galileo measured the periods of a
swinging chandelier in a church by his pulse
beats. He observed that the motion of the
chandelier was periodic. The system is a kind
of pendulum. You can also make your own
pendulum by tying a piece of stone to a long
unstretchable thread, approximately 100 cm
long. Suspend your pendulum from a suitable
support so that it is free to oscillate. Displace
the stone to one side by a small distance and

the mean position. Consider simple pendulum
— a small bob of mass m tied to an inextensible
massless string of length L. The other end of
the string is fixed to a rigid support. The bob
oscillates in a plane about the vertical line
through the support. Fig. 13.17(a) shows this
system. Fig. 13.17(b) is a kind of ‘free-body’
diagram of the simple pendulum showing the
forces acting on the bob.
Let θ be the angle made by the string with
the vertical. When the bob is at the mean
position, θ = 0
There are only two forces acting on the bob;
the tension T along the string and the vertical

force due to gravity (=mg). The force mg can be
resolved into the component mg cosθ along the
string and mg sinθ perpendicular to it. Since
the motion of the bob is along a circle of length
L and centre at the support point, the bob has
a radial acceleration (ω2L) and also a tangental
acceleration; the latter arises since motion along
the arc of the circle is not uniform. The radial
acceleration is provided by the net radial force
T –mg cosθ, while the tangential acceleration is
provided by mg sinθ. It is more convenient to
work with torque about the support since the
radial force gives zero torque. Torque τ about
the support is entirely provided by the tangental
component of force

τ = –L (mg sinθ )

In Table 13.1, we have listed the angle θ in
degrees, its equivalent in radians, and the
value of the function sin θ . From this table it
can be seen that for θ as large as 20 degrees,
sin θ is nearly the same as θ expressed
in radians.

Equation (13.24) is mathematically, identical to
Eq. (13.11) except that the variable is angular
displacement. Hence we have proved that for
small q, the motion of the bob is simple harmonic.
From Eqs. (13.24) and (13.11),

This is the restoring torque that tends to reduce
angular displacement — hence the negative
sign. By Newton’s law of rotational motion,

SUMMARY
1.
2.

The motion that repeats itself is called periodlic motion.
The period T is the time reequired for one complete oscillation, or cycle. It is related to
the frequency v by,

T =

1
v

The frequency ν of periodic or oscillatory motion is the number of oscillations per
unit time. In the SI, it is measured in hertz :
1 hertz = 1 Hz = 1 oscillation per second = 1s–1
3.

In simple harmonic motion (SHM), the displacement x (t) of a particle from its
equilibrium position is given by,
x (t) = A cos (ωt + φ )

(displacement),

in which A is the amplitude of the displacement, the quantity (ωt + φ ) is the phase of
the motion, and φ is the phase constant. The angular frequency ω is related to the
period and frequency of the motion by,

ω=

2π
= 2πν
T

(angular frequency).

4.

Simple harmonic motion can also be viewed as the projection of uniform circular
motion on the diameter of the circle in which the latter motion occurs.

5.

The particle velocity and acceleration during SHM as functions of time are given by,
v (t) = –ωA sin (ωt + φ )

(velocity),

a (t) = –ω2A cos (ωt + φ )
= –ω2x (t)

(acceleration),

Thus we see that both velocity and acceleration of a body executing simple harmonic
motion are periodic functions, having the velocity amplitude vm=ω A and acceleration
amplitude am =ω 2A, respectively.
6.

The force acting in a simple harmonic motion is proportional to the displacement and
is always directed towards the centre of motion.

7.

A particle executing simple harmonic motion has, at any time, kinetic energy
K = ½ mv2 and potential energy U = ½ kx2. If no friction is present the mechanical
energy of the system, E = K + U always remains constant even though K and U change
with time.

POINTS TO PONDER
1.

The period T is the least time after which motion repeats itself. Thus, motion repeats
itself after nT where n is an integer.

2.

Every periodic motion is not simple harmonic motion. Only that periodic motion
governed by the force law F = – k x is simple harmonic.

3.

Circular motion can arise due to an inverse-square law force (as in planetary motion)
as well as due to simple harmonic force in two dimensions equal to: –mω2r. In the
latter case, the phases of motion, in two perpendicular directions (x and y) must differ
by π/2. Thus, for example, a particle subject to a force –mω2r with initial position (0,
A) and velocity (ωA, 0) will move uniformly in a circle of radius A.

4.

For linear simple harmonic motion with a given ω, two initial conditions are necessary
and sufficient to determine the motion completely. The initial conditions may be (i)
initial position and initial velocity or (ii) amplitude and phase or (iii) energy
and phase.

5.

From point 4 above, given amplitude or energy, phase of motion is determined by the
initial position or initial velocity.

6.

A combination of two simple harmonic motions with arbitrary amplitudes and phases
is not necessarily periodic. It is periodic only if frequency of one motion is an integral
multiple of the other’s frequency. However, a periodic motion can always be expressed
as a sum of infinite number of harmonic motions with appropriate amplitudes.

7.

The period of SHM does not depend on amplitude or energy or the phase constant.
Contrast this with the periods of planetary orbits under gravitation (Kepler’s third law).

8.

The motion of a simple pendulum is simple harmonic for small angular displacement.

9.

For motion of a particle to be simple harmonic, its displacement x must be expressible
in either of the following forms :
x = A cos ωt + B sin ωt
x = A cos (ωt + α ), x = B sin (ωt + β )
The three forms are completely equivalent (any one can be expressed in terms of any
other two forms).
Thus, damped simple harmonic motion is not strictly simple harmonic. It is
approximately so only for time intervals much less than 2m/b where b is the damping
constant.

INTRODUCTION

In the previous Chapter, we studied the motion of objects
oscillating in isolation. What happens in a system, which is
a collection of such objects? A material medium provides
such an example. Here, elastic forces bind the constituents
to each other and, therefore, the motion of one affects that of
the other. If you drop a little pebble in a pond of still water,
the water surface gets disturbed. The disturbance does not
remain confined to one place, but propagates outward along
a circle. If you continue dropping pebbles in the pond, you
see circles rapidly moving outward from the point where the
water surface is disturbed. It gives a feeling as if the water is
moving outward from the point of disturbance. If you put
some cork pieces on the disturbed surface, it is seen that
the cork pieces move up and down but do not move away
from the centre of disturbance. This shows that the water
mass does not flow outward with the circles, but rather a
moving disturbance is created. Similarly, when we speak,
the sound moves outward from us, without any flow of air
from one part of the medium to another. The disturbances
produced in air are much less obvious and only our ears or
a microphone can detect them. These patterns, which move
without the actual physical transfer or flow of matter as a
whole, are called waves. In this Chapter, we will study such
waves.
Waves transport energy and the pattern of disturbance has
information that propagate from one point to another. All our
communications essentially depend on transmission of signals through waves. Speech means production of sound
waves in air and hearing amounts to their detection. Often,
communication involves different kinds of waves. For example, sound waves may be first converted into an electric current signal which in turn may generate an electromagnetic
wave that may be transmitted by an optical cable or via a



WAVES

279

satellite. Detection of the original signal will usually involve these steps in reverse order.
Not all waves require a medium for their
propagation. We know that light waves can
travel through vacuum. The light emitted by
stars, which are hundreds of light years away,
reaches us through inter-stellar space, which
is practically a vacuum.
The most familiar type of waves such as waves
on a string, water waves, sound waves, seismic
waves, etc. is the so-called mechanical waves.
These waves require a medium for propagation,
they cannot propagate through vacuum. They
involve oscillations of constituent particles and
depend on the elastic properties of the medium.
The electromagnetic waves that you will learn
in Class XII are a different type of wave.
Electromagnetic waves do not necessarily require
a medium - they can travel through vacuum.
Light, radiowaves, X-rays, are all electromagnetic
waves. In vacuum, all electromagnetic waves
have the same speed c, whose value is :
c = 299, 792, 458 ms–1.

(14.1)

A third kind of wave is the so-called Matter
waves. They are associated with constituents of
matter : electrons, protons, neutrons, atoms and
molecules. They arise in quantum mechanical
description of nature that you will learn in your
later studies. Though conceptually more abstract
than mechanical or electro-magnetic waves, they
have already found applications in several
devices basic to modern technology; matter
waves associated with electrons are employed
in electron microscopes.
In this chapter we will study mechanical
waves, which require a material medium for
their propagation.
The aesthetic influence of waves on art and
literature is seen from very early times; yet the
first scientific analysis of wave motion dates back
to the seventeenth century. Some of the famous
scientists associated with the physics of wave
motion are Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695),
Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton. The
understanding of physics of waves followed the
physics of oscillations of masses tied to springs
and physics of the simple pendulum. Waves in
elastic media are intimately connected with
harmonic oscillations. (Stretched strings, coiled
springs, air, etc., are examples of elastic media).

We shall illustrate this connection through
simple examples.
Consider a collection of springs connected to
one another as shown in Fig. 14.1. If the spring
at one end is pulled suddenly and released, the
disturbance travels to the other end. What has

Fig. 14.1 A collection of springs connected to each
other. The end A is pulled suddenly
generating a disturbance, which then
propagates to the other end.

happened? The first spring is disturbed from its
equilibrium length. Since the second spring is
connected to the first, it is also stretched or
compressed, and so on. The disturbance moves
from one end to the other; but each spring only
executes small oscillations about its equilibrium
position. As a practical example of this situation,
consider a stationary train at a railway station.
Different bogies of the train are coupled to each
other through a spring coupling. When an
engine is attached at one end, it gives a push to
the bogie next to it; this push is transmitted from
one bogie to another without the entire train
being bodily displaced.
Now let us consider the propagation of sound
waves in air. As the wave passes through air, it
compresses or expands a small region of air. This
causes a change in the density of that region,
say δρ, this change induces a change in pressure,
δp, in that region. Pressure is force per unit area,
so there is a restoring force proportional to
the disturbance, just like in a spring. In this
case, the quantity similar to extension or
compression of the spring is the change in
density. If a region is compressed, the molecules
in that region are packed together, and they tend
to move out to the adjoining region, thereby
increasing the density or creating compression
in the adjoining region. Consequently, the air
in the first region undergoes rarefaction. If a
region is comparatively rarefied the surrounding
air will rush in making the rarefaction move to
the adjoining region. Thus, the compression or
rarefaction moves from one region to another,
making the propagation of a disturbance
possible in air.



280

PHYSICS

In solids, similar arguments can be made. In
a crystalline solid, atoms or group of atoms are
arranged in a periodic lattice. In these, each
atom or group of atoms is in equilibrium, due to
forces from the surrounding atoms. Displacing
one atom, keeping the others fixed, leads to
restoring forces, exactly as in a spring. So we
can think of atoms in a lattice as end points,
with springs between pairs of them.
In the subsequent sections of this chapter
we are going to discuss various characteristic
properties of waves.
14.2

TRANSVERSE AND LONGITUDINAL
WAVES

We have seen that motion of mechanical waves
involves oscillations of constituents of the
medium. If the constituents of the medium
oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave
propagation, we call the wave a transverse wave.
If they oscillate along the direction of wave
propagation, we call the wave a longitudinal
wave.
Fig.14.2 shows the propagation of a single
pulse along a string, resulting from a single up
and down jerk. If the string is very long compared

Fig. 14.3 A harmonic (sinusoidal) wave travelling
along a stretched string is an example of a
transverse wave. An element of the string
in the region of the wave oscillates about
its equilibrium position perpendicular to the
direction of wave propagation.

position as the pulse or wave passes through
them. The oscillations are normal to the
direction of wave motion along the string, so this
is an example of transverse wave.
We can look at a wave in two ways. We can fix
an instant of time and picture the wave in space.
This will give us the shape of the wave as a
whole in space at a given instant. Another way
is to fix a location i.e. fix our attention on a
particular element of string and see its
oscillatory motion in time.
Fig. 14.4 describes the situation for
longitudinal waves in the most familiar example
of the propagation of sound waves. A long pipe
filled with air has a piston at one end. A single
sudden push forward and pull back of the piston
will generate a pulse of condensations (higher
density) and rarefactions (lower density) in the
medium (air). If the push-pull of the piston is
continuous and periodic (sinusoidal), a

Fig. 14.2 When a pulse travels along the length of a
stretched string (x-direction), the elements
of the string oscillate up and down (ydirection)

to the size of the pulse, the pulse will damp out
before it reaches the other end and reflection
from that end may be ignored. Fig. 14.3 shows a
similar situation, but this time the external
agent gives a continuous periodic sinusoidal up
and down jerk to one end of the string. The
resulting disturbance on the string is then a
sinusoidal wave. In either case the elements of
the string oscillate about their equilibrium mean

pipe filled with air by moving the piston up
and down. A volume element of air oscillates
in the direction parallel to the direction of
wave propagation.



WAVES

281

sinusoidal wave will be generated propagating
in air along the length of the pipe. This is clearly
an example of longitudinal waves.
The waves considered above, transverse or
longitudinal, are travelling or progressive waves
since they travel from one part of the medium
to another. The material medium as a whole
does not move, as already noted. A stream, for
example, constitutes motion of water as a whole.
In a water wave, it is the disturbance that moves,
not water as a whole. Likewise a wind (motion
of air as a whole) should not be confused with a
sound wave which is a propagation of
disturbance (in pressure density) in air, without
the motion of air medium as a whole.
In transverse waves, the particle motion is
normal to the direction of propagation of the
wave. Therefore, as the wave propagates, each
element of the medium undergoes a shearing
strain. Transverse waves can, therefore, be
propagated only in those media, which can
sustain shearing stress, such as solids and not
in fluids. Fluids, as well as, solids can sustain
compressive strain; therefore, longitudinal
waves can be propagated in all elastic media.
For example, in medium like steel, both
transverse and longitudinal waves can
propagate, while air can sustain only
longitudinal waves. The waves on the surface
of water are of two kinds: capillary waves and
gravity waves. The former are ripples of fairly
short wavelength—not more than a few
centimetre—and the restoring force that
produces them is the surface tension of water.
Gravity waves have wavelengths typically
ranging from several metres to several hundred
meters. The restoring force that produces these
waves is the pull of gravity, which tends to keep
the water surface at its lowest level. The
oscillations of the particles in these waves are
not confined to the surface only, but extend with
diminishing amplitude to the very bottom. The
particle motion in water waves involves a
complicated motion—they not only move up and
down but also back and forth. The waves in an
ocean are the combination of both longitudinal
and transverse waves.
It is found that, generally, transverse and
longitudinal waves travel with different speed
in the same medium.

DISPLACEMENT RELATION
A PROGRESSIVE WAVE

For mathematical description of a travelling
wave, we need a function of both position x and
time t. Such a function at every instant should
give the shape of the wave at that instant. Also,
at every given location, it should describe the
motion of the constituent of the medium at that
location. If we wish to describe a sinusoidal
travelling wave (such as the one shown in Fig.
14.3) the corresponding function must also be
sinusoidal. For convenience, we shall take the
wave to be transverse so that if the position of
the constituents of the medium is denoted by x,
the displacement from the equilibrium position
may be denoted by y. A sinusoidal travelling
wave is then described by:

y( x, t ) = a sin( kx − ωt + φ)

(14.2)
The term φ in the argument of sine function
means equivalently that we are considering a
linear combination of sine and cosine functions:

y ( x ,t ) = A sin(kx − ωt ) + B cos(kx − ωt ) (14.3)

kx + constant. Thus, the shape of the wave (at
any fixed instant) as a function of x is a sine
wave. Similarly, take a fixed location, say x = x0.
Then, the argument of the sine function in
Equation (14.2) is constant -ωt. The
displacement y, at a fixed location, thus, varies
sinusoidally with time. That is, the constituents
of the medium at different positions execute
simple harmonic motion. Finally, as t increases,
x must increase in the positive direction to keep
kx – ωt + φ constant. Thus, Eq. (14.2) represents
a sinusiodal (harmonic) wave travelling along
the positive direction of the x-axis. On the other
hand, a function

y ( x, t ) = a sin( kx + ω t + φ )

(14.4)
represents a wave travelling in the negative
direction of x-axis. Fig. (14.5) gives the names of
the various physical quantities appearing in Eq.

Using the plots of Fig. 14.6, we now define
the various quantities of Eq. (14.2).
14.3.1 Amplitude and Phase

Fig. 14.6 shows the plots of Eq. (14.2) for
different values of time differing by equal
intervals of time. In a wave, the crest is the
point of maximum positive displacement, the
trough is the point of maximum negative
displacement. To see how a wave travels, we
can fix attention on a crest and see how it
progresses with time. In the figure, this is
shown by a cross (×) on the crest. In the same
manner, we can see the motion of a particular
constituent of the medium at a fixed location,
say at the origin of the x-axis. This is shown
by a solid dot (•). The plots of Fig. 14.6 show
that with time, the solid dot (•) at the origin
moves periodically, i.e., the particle at the
origin oscillates about its mean position as
the wave progresses. This is true for any other
location also. We also see that during the time
the solid dot (•) has completed one full
oscillation, the crest has moved further by a
certain distance.

In Eq. (14.2), since the sine function varies
between 1 and –1, the displacement y (x,t) varies
between a and –a. We can take a to be a positive
constant, without any loss of generality. Then,
a represents the maximum displacement of the
constituents of the medium from their
equilibrium position. Note that the displacement
y may be positive or negative, but a is positive.
It is called the amplitude of the wave.
The quantity (kx – ωt + φ) appearing as the
argument of the sine function in Eq. (14.2) is
called the phase of the wave. Given the
amplitude a, the phase determines the
displacement of the wave at any position and
at any instant. Clearly φ is the phase at x = 0
and t = 0. Hence, φ is called the initial phase
angle. By suitable choice of origin on the x-axis
and the intial time, it is possible to have φ = 0.
Thus there is no loss of generality in dropping
φ, i.e., in taking Eq. (14.2) with φ = 0.

14.3.2 Wavelength and Angular Wave
Number
The minimum distance between two points
having the same phase is called the wavelength
of the wave, usually denoted by λ. For simplicity,
we can choose points of the same phase to be
crests or troughs. The wavelength is then the
distance between two consecutive crests or
troughs in a wave. Taking φ = 0 in Eq. (14.2),
the displacement at t = 0 is given by

y ( x, 0) = a sin kx

(14.5)

Since the sine function repeats its value after
every 2π change in angle,

Fig. 14.7 An element of a string at a fixed location
oscillates in time with amplitude a and
period T, as the wave passes over it.

Now, the period of oscillation of the wave is the
time it takes for an element to complete one full
oscillation. That is

−a sin ωt = −a sin ω (t + T )
= −a sin(ωt + ω T )
That is the displacements at points x and at

14.3.3 Period, Angular Frequency and
Frequency
Fig. 14.7 shows again a sinusoidal plot. It
describes not the shape of the wave at a certain
instant but the displacement of an element (at
any fixed location) of the medium as a function
of time. We may for, simplicity, take Eq. (14.2)
with φ = 0 and monitor the motion of the element
say at x = 0 . We then get

y(0,t ) = a sin( −ωt )

= −a sin ωt

2π

(14.7)

ω is called the angular frequency of the wave.
Its SI unit is rad s –1. The frequency ν is the
number of oscillations per second. Therefore,

ν=

(14.8)

ν is usually measured in hertz.
In the discussion above, reference has always
been made to a wave travelling along a string or
a transverse wave. In a longitudinal wave, the
displacement of an element of the medium is
parallel to the direction of propagation of the
wave. In Eq. (14.2), the displacement function
for a longitudinal wave is written as,
s(x, t) = a sin (kx – ω t + φ )

(14.9)

where s(x, t) is the displacement of an element
of the medium in the direction of propagation
of the wave at position x and time t. In Eq. (14.9),
a is the displacement amplitude; other
quantities have the same meaning as in case
of a transverse wave except that the
displacement function y (x, t ) is to be replaced
by the function s (x, t).

* Here again, ‘radian’ could be dropped and the units could be written merely as m–1. Thus, k represents 2π
times the number of waves (or the total phase difference) that can be accommodated per unit length, with SI
units m–1.

3.0 rad s–1). Calculate (a) the amplitude,
(b) the wavelength, and (c) the period and
frequency of the wave. Also, calculate the
displacement y of the wave at a distance
x = 30.0 cm and time t = 20 s ?

Answer On comparing this displacement
equation with Eq. (14.2),
y (x, t ) = a sin (kx – ω t ),
we find
(a) the amplitude of the wave is 0.005 m = 5 mm.
(b) the angular wave number k and angular
frequency ω are
k = 80.0 m–1 and ω = 3.0 s–1

14.4 THE SPEED OF A TRAVELLING WAVE
To determine the speed of propagation of a
travelling wave, we can fix our attention on any

moves in time. It is convenient to look at the
motion of the crest of the wave. Fig. 14.8 gives

Eq. (14.12), a general relation for all progressive
waves, shows that in the time required for one full
oscillation by any constituent of the medium, the
wave pattern travels a distance equal to the
wavelength of the wave. It should be noted that
the speed of a mechanical wave is determined by
the inertial (linear mass density for strings, mass
density in general) and elastic properties (Young’s
modulus for linear media/ shear modulus, bulk
modulus) of the medium. The medium determines



WAVES

285

the speed; Eq. (14.12) then relates wavelength to
frequency for the given speed. Of course, as
remarked earlier, the medium can support both
transverse and longitudinal waves, which will have
different speeds in the same medium. Later in this
chapter, we shall obtain specific expressions for
the speed of mechanical waves in some media.
14.4.1

Speed of a Transverse Wave on
Stretched String

The speed of a mechanical wave is determined
by the restoring force setup in the medium when
it is disturbed and the inertial properties (mass
density) of the medium. The speed is expected to
be directly related to the former and inversely to
the latter. For waves on a string, the restoring
force is provided by the tension T in the string.
The inertial property will in this case be linear
mass density µ, which is mass m of the string
divided by its length L. Using Newton’s Laws of
Motion, an exact formula for the wave speed on
a string can be derived, but this derivation is
outside the scope of this book. We shall,
therefore, use dimensional analysis. We already
know that dimensional analysis alone can never
yield the exact formula. The overall
dimensionless constant is always left
undetermined by dimensional analysis.
The dimension of µ is [ML–1] and that of T is
like force, namely [MLT–2]. We need to combine
these dimensions to get the dimension of speed
v [LT –1]. Simple inspection shows that the
quantity T/µ has the relevant dimension

 MLT −2 
=  L2 T −2 
[ ML ]
Thus if T and µ are assumed to be the only
relevant physical quantities,

T

v =C

where C is the undetermined constant of
dimensional analysis. In the exact formula, it
turms out, C=1. The speed of transverse waves
on a stretched string is given by

arising due to an external force). It does not
depend on wavelength or frequency of the wave
itself. In higher studies, you will come across
waves whose speed is not independent of
frequency of the wave. Of the two parameters λ
and ν the source of disturbance determines the
frequency of the wave generated. Given the
speed of the wave in the medium and the
frequency Eq. (14.12) then fixes the wavelength

14.4.2 Speed of a Longitudinal Wave
(Speed of Sound)
In a longitudinal wave, the constituents of the
medium oscillate forward and backward in the
direction of propagation of the wave. We have
already seen that the sound waves travel in the
form of compressions and rarefactions of small
volume elements of air. The elastic property that
determines the stress under compressional
strain is the bulk modulus of the medium defined
by (see Chapter 8)
B=−

∆P
∆V/V

(14.16)

Here, the change in pressure ∆P produces a
volumetric strain

v =

∆V
. B has the same dimension
V

as pressure and given in SI units in terms of
pascal (Pa). The inertial property relevant for the
propagation of wave is the mass density ρ, with
dimensions [ML–3]. Simple inspection reveals
that quantity B/ρ has the relevant dimension:



286

PHYSICS

 ML −2 T −2 
=  L2 T −2 
 ML −3 

(14.17)

Thus, if B and ρ are considered to be the only
relevant physical quantities,
B

v =C

(14.18)
ρ
where, as before, C is the undetermined constant
from dimensional analysis. The exact derivation
shows that C=1. Thus, the general formula for
longitudinal waves in a medium is:
v =

B

ρ

(14.19)

For a linear medium, like a solid bar, the
lateral expansion of the bar is negligible and we
may consider it to be only under longitudinal
strain. In that case, the relevant modulus of
elasticity is Young’s modulus, which has the
same dimension as the Bulk modulus.
Dimensional analysis for this case is the same
as before and yields a relation like Eq. (14.18),
with an undetermined C, which the exact
derivation shows to be unity. Thus, the speed of
longitudinal waves in a solid bar is given by
v =

Y

ρ

Liquids and solids generally have higher speed
of sound than gases. [Note for solids, the speed
being referred to is the speed of longitudinal
waves in the solid]. This happens because they
are much more difficult to compress than gases
and so have much higher values of bulk modulus.
Now, see Eq. (14.19). Solids and liquids have
higher mass densities ( ρ ) than gases. But the
corresponding increase in both the modulus (B)
of solids and liquids is much higher. This is the
reason why the sound waves travel faster in
solids and liquids.
We can estimate the speed of sound in a gas
in the ideal gas approximation. For an ideal gas,
the pressure P, volume V and temperature T are
related by (see Chapter 10).
PV = NkBT

(14.21)

where N is the number of molecules in volume
V, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T the
temperature of the gas (in Kelvin). Therefore, for
an isothermal change it follows from Eq.(14.21)
that
V∆P + P∆V = 0
or

−

∆P
=P
∆V/V

Hence, substituting in Eq. (14.16), we have
(14.20)

where Y is the Young’s modulus of the material
of the bar. Table 14.1 gives the speed of sound
in some media.

B=P

Therefore, from Eq. (14.19) the speed of a
longitudinal wave in an ideal gas is given by,
v =

This relation was first given by Newton and
is known as Newton’s formula.

sound in air at standard temperature and
pressure. The mass of 1 mole of air is
29.0 ×10–3 kg.

Answer We know that 1 mole of any gas occupies
22.4 litres at STP. Therefore, density of air at
STP is:
ρo = (mass of one mole of air)/ (volume of one

287

According to Newton’s formula for the speed
of sound in a medium, we get for the speed of
sound in air at STP,
= 280 m s–1 (14.23)
⊳
The result shown in Eq.(14.23) is about 15%
smaller as compared to the experimental value
of 331 m s–1 as given in Table 14.1. Where
did we go wrong ? If we examine the basic
assumption made by Newton that the pressure
variations in a medium during propagation of
sound are isothermal, we find that this is not
correct. It was pointed out by Laplace that the
pressure variations in the propagation of sound
waves are so fast that there is little time for the
heat flow to maintain constant temperature.
These variations, therefore, are adiabatic and
not isothermal. For adiabatic processes the ideal
gas satisfies the relation (see Section 11.8),
PV γ = constant
i.e.
or

∆(PV γ ) = 0
P γ V γ –1 ∆V + V γ ∆P = 0

where γ is the ratio of two specific heats,
Cp/Cv.
Thus, for an ideal gas the adiabatic bulk
modulus is given by,
Bad = − ∆P

∆V/V

= γP
The speed of sound is, therefore, from Eq.
(14.19), given by,
v=

γP
ρ

(14.24)

This modification of Newton’s formula is referred
to as the Laplace correction. For air
γ = 7/5. Now using Eq. (14.24) to estimate the speed
of sound in air at STP, we get a value 331.3 m s–1,
which agrees with the measured speed.
14.5 THE PRINCIPLE OF SUPERPOSITION
OF WAVES
What happens when two wave pulses travelling
in opposite directions cross each other
(Fig. 14.9)? It turns out that wave pulses
continue to retain their identities after they have
crossed. However, during the time they overlap,
the wave pattern is different from either of the

Fig. 14.9 Two pulses having equal and opposite
displacements moving in opposite
directions. The overlapping pulses add up
to zero displacement in curve (c).

pulses. Figure 14.9 shows the situation when
two pulses of equal and opposite shapes move
towards each other. When the pulses overlap,
the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum
of the displacement due to each pulse. This is
known as the principle of superposition of waves.
According to this principle, each pulse moves
as if others are not present. The constituents of
the medium, therefore, suffer displacments due
to both and since the displacements can be
positive and negative, the net displacement is
an algebraic sum of the two. Fig. 14.9 gives
graphs of the wave shape at different times. Note
the dramatic effect in the graph (c); the
displacements due to the two pulses have exactly
cancelled each other and there is zero
displacement throughout.
To put the principle of superposition
mathematically, let y1 (x,t) and y2 (x,t) be the
displacements due to two wave disturbances in
the medium. If the waves arrive in a region
simultaneously, and therefore, overlap, the net
displacement y (x,t) is given by
y (x, t) = y1(x, t) + y2(x, t)

(14.25)

If we have two or more waves moving in the
medium the resultant waveform is the sum of
wave functions of individual waves. That is, if
the wave functions of the moving waves are



288

PHYSICS

y1 = f1(x–vt),
y2 = f2(x–vt),

yn = fn (x–vt)
then the wave function describing the

n
= ∑ f
i =1

i (

x − vt )

(14.26)

The principle of superposition is basic to the
phenomenon of interference.
For simplicity, consider two harmonic
travelling waves on a stretched string, both with
the same ω (angular frequency) and k (wave
number), and, therefore, the same wavelength
λ. Their wave speed will be identical. Let us
further assume that their amplitudes are equal
and they are both travelling in the positive
direction of x-axis. The waves only differ in their
initial phase. According to Eq. (14.2), the two
waves are described by the functions:
y1(x, t) = a sin (kx – ω t)

(14.27)

and y2(x, t) = a sin (kx – ω t + φ )

(14.28)

The net displacement is then, by the principle
of superposition, given by
y (x, t ) = a sin (kx – ω t) + a sin (kx – ω t + φ )

Eq. (14.31) is also a harmonic travelling wave in
the positive direction of x-axis, with the same
frequency and wavelength. However, its initial
phase angle is

. The significant thing is that

its amplitude is a function of the phase difference

Fig. 14.10 The resultant of two harmonic waves of
equal amplitude and wavelength

The amplitude of the resultant wave
depends on the phase difference φ, which
is zero for (a) and π for (b)

φ between the constituent two waves:
(14.32)
A(φ) = 2a cos ½φ
For φ = 0, when the waves are in phase,

y ( x, t ) = 2a sin ( kx − ωt )

(14.33)

i.e., the resultant wave has amplitude 2a, the
largest possible value for A. For φ = π , the
waves are completely, out of phase and the
resultant wave has zero displacement
everywhere at all times
y (x, t ) = 0
(14.34)
Eq. (14.33) refers to the so-called constructive
interference of the two waves where the
amplitudes add up in the resultant wave. Eq.
(14.34) is the case of destructive intereference
where the amplitudes subtract out in the
resultant wave. Fig. 14.10 shows these two cases
of interference of waves arising from the
principle of superposition.
14.6

REFLECTION OF WAVES

So far we considered waves propagating in an
unbounded medium. What happens if a pulse
or a wave meets a boundary? If the boundary is
rigid, the pulse or wave gets reflected. The



WAVES

289

phenomenon of echo is an example of reflection
by a rigid boundary. If the boundary is not
completely rigid or is an interface between two
different elastic media, the situation is some
what complicated. A part of the incident wave is
reflected and a part is transmitted into the
second medium. If a wave is incident obliquely
on the boundary between two different media
the transmitted wave is called the refracted
wave. The incident and refracted waves obey
Snell’s law of refraction, and the incident and
reflected waves obey the usual laws of
reflection.
Fig. 14.11 shows a pulse travelling along a
stretched string and being reflected by the
boundary. Assuming there is no absorption of
energy by the boundary, the reflected wave has
the same shape as the incident pulse but it
suffers a phase change of π or 1800 on reflection.
This is because the boundary is rigid and the
disturbance must have zero displacement at all
times at the boundary. By the principle of
superposition, this is possible only if the reflected
and incident waves differ by a phase of π, so that
the resultant displacement is zero. This
reasoning is based on boundary condition on a
rigid wall. We can arrive at the same conclusion
dynamically also. As the pulse arrives at the wall,
it exerts a force on the wall. By Newton’s Third
Law, the wall exerts an equal and opposite force
on the string generating a reflected pulse that
differs by a phase of π.

If on the other hand, the boundary point is
not rigid but completely free to move (such as in
the case of a string tied to a freely moving ring
on a rod), the reflected pulse has the same phase
and amplitude (assuming no energy dissipation)
as the incident pulse. The net maximum
displacement at the boundary is then twice the
amplitude of each pulse. An example of non- rigid
boundary is the open end of an organ pipe.
To summarise, a travelling wave or pulse
suffers a phase change of π on reflection at a
rigid boundary and no phase change on
reflection at an open boundary. To put this
mathematically, let the incident travelling
wave be

y2 ( x, t ) = a sin ( kx − ωt )
At a rigid boundary, the reflected wave is given
by
yr(x, t) = a sin (kx – ω t + π ).
= – a sin (kx – ω t)
(14.35)
At an open boundary, the reflected wave is given
by
yr(x, t) = a sin (kx – ω t + 0).
= a sin (kx – ω t)
(14.36)
Clearly, at the rigid boundary, y = y2 + yr = 0
at all times.
14.6.1 Standing Waves and Normal Modes
We considered above reflection at one boundary.
But there are familiar situations (a string fixed
at either end or an air column in a pipe with
either end closed) in which reflection takes place
at two or more boundaries. In a string, for
example, a wave travelling in one direction will
get reflected at one end, which in turn will travel
and get reflected from the other end. This will
go on until there is a steady wave pattern set
up on the string. Such wave patterns are called
standing waves or stationary waves. To see this
mathematically, consider a wave travelling
along the positive direction of x-axis and a
reflected wave of the same amplitude and
wavelength in the negative direction of x-axis.
From Eqs. (14.2) and (14.4), with φ = 0, we get:
y1(x, t) = a sin (kx – ω t)
y2(x, t) = a sin (kx + ω t)

Fig. 14.11 Reflection of a pulse meeting a rigid
boundary.

The resultant wave on the string is, according
to the principle of superposition:
y (x, t) = y1(x, t) + y2(x, t)



290

PHYSICS

= a [sin (kx – ω t) + sin (k x + ω t)]
Using the familiar trignometric identity
Sin (A+B) + Sin (A–B) = 2 sin A cosB we get,
y (x, t) = 2a sin kx cos ω t

(14.37)

Note the important difference in the wave
pattern described by Eq. (14.37) from that
described by Eq. (14.2) or Eq. (14.4). The terms
kx and ω t appear separately, not in the
combination kx - ωt. The amplitude of this wave
is 2a sin kx. Thus, in this wave pattern, the
amplitude varies from point-to-point, but each
element of the string oscillates with the same
angular frequency ω or time period. There is no
phase difference between oscillations of different
elements of the wave. The string as a whole
vibrates in phase with differing amplitudes at
different points. The wave pattern is neither
moving to the right nor to the left. Hence, they
are called standing or stationary waves. The
amplitude is fixed at a given location but, as
remarked earlier, it is different at different
locations. The points at which the amplitude is
zero (i.e., where there is no motion at all) are

nodes; the points at which the amplitude is the
largest are called antinodes. Fig. 14.12 shows
a stationary wave pattern resulting from
superposition of two travelling waves in
opposite directions.
The most significant feature of stationary
waves is that the boundary conditions constrain
the possible wavelengths or frequencies of
vibration of the system. The system cannot
oscillate with any arbitrary frequency (contrast
this with a harmonic travelling wave), but is
characterised by a set of natural frequencies or
normal modes of oscillation. Let us determine
these normal modes for a stretched string fixed
at both ends.
First, from Eq. (14.37), the positions of nodes
(where the amplitude is zero) are given by
sin kx = 0 .
which implies
kx = n π; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
Since, k = 2π/λ , we get
x=

Clearly, the distance between any two
successive nodes is

λ
2.

In the same way, the

positions of antinodes (where the amplitude is
the largest) are given by the largest value of sin
kx :
sin k x = 1
which implies
kx = (n + ½) π ; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
With k = 2π/λ, we get
x = (n + ½)

; n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

(14.39)

Again the distance between any two consecutive
antinodes is

λ
2

. Eq. (14.38) can be applied to

speed of wave determined by the properties of
the medium. The n = 2 frequency is called the
second harmonic; n = 3 is the third harmonic
and so on. We can label the various harmonics by
the symbol νn ( n = 1, 2, ...).
Fig. 14.13 shows the first six harmonics of a
stretched string fixed at either end. A string
need not vibrate in one of these modes only.
Generally, the vibration of a string will be a
superposition of different modes; some modes
may be more strongly excited and some less.
Musical instruments like sitar or violin are
based on this principle. Where the string is
plucked or bowed, determines which modes are
more prominent than others.
Let us next consider normal modes of
oscillation of an air column with one end closed

the case of a stretched string of
length L fixed at both ends. Taking
one end to be at x = 0, the boundary
conditions are that x = 0 and x = L
are positions of nodes. The x = 0
condition is already satisfied. The
x = L node condition requires that
the length L is related to λ by

mode or the first harmonic. For the

it is given by v =

with water illustrates this system. The end in
contact with water is a node, while the open end
is an antinode. At the node the pressure
changes are the largest, while the displacement
is minimum (zero). At the open end - the
antinode, it is just the other way - least pressure
change and maximum amplitude of
displacement. Taking the end in contact with
water to be x = 0, the node condition (Eq. 14.38)
is already satisfied. If the other end x = L is an

14.7 BEATS
‘Beats’ is an interesting phenomenon arising
from interference of waves. When two harmonic
sound waves of close (but not equal) frequencies
are heard at the same time, we hear a sound of
similar frequency (the average of two close
frequencies), but we hear something else also.
We hear audibly distinct waxing and waning of
the intensity of the sound, with a frequency
equal to the difference in the two close
frequencies. Artists use this phenomenon often

while tuning their instruments with each other.
They go on tuning until their sensitive ears do
not detect any beats.
To see this mathematically, let us consider
two harmonic sound waves of nearly equal
angular frequency ω1 and ω2 and fix the location
to be x = 0 for convenience. Eq. (14.2) with a
suitable choice of phase (φ = π/2 for each) and,
assuming equal amplitudes, gives
(14.45)
s1 = a cos ω1t and s2 = a cos ω2t
Here we have replaced the symbol y by s,
since we are referring to longitudinal not
transverse displacement. Let ω1 be the (slightly)
greater of the two frequencies. The resultant
displacement is, by the principle of
superposition,
s = s1 + s2 = a (cos ω1 t + cos ω2 t)
Using the familiar trignometric identity for
cos A + cosB, we get

= 2 a cos

(ω1 - ω2 )t cos ( ω1 + ω2 ) t

2
2
which may be written as :
s = [ 2 a cos ωb t ] cos ωat
If |ω1 – ω2| <<ω1, ω2, ωa >> ωb, th

Now if we assume |ω1 – ω2| <<ω1, which means
ωa >> ωb, we can interpret Eq. (14.47) as follows.
The resultant wave is oscillating with the average
angular frequency ωa; however its amplitude is
not constant in time, unlike a pure harmonic
wave. The amplitude is the largest when the
term cos ωb t takes its limit +1 or –1. In other
words, the intensity of the resultant wave waxes
and wanes with a frequency which is 2ωb = ω1 –

given by
νbeat = ν1 – ν2

Fig. 14.16 illustrates the phenomenon of
beats for two harmonic waves of frequencies 11
Hz and 9 Hz. The amplitude of the resultant wave
shows beats at a frequency of 2 Hz.

Musical Pillars
Temples often have some pillars portraying
human figures playing musical instruments, but seldom do these pillars
themselves produce music. At the
Nellaiappar temple in Tamil Nadu, gentle
taps on a cluster of pillars carved out of a
single piece of rock produce the basic notes
of Indian classical music, viz. Sa, Re, Ga,
Ma, Pa, Dha, Ni, Sa. Vibrations of these
pillars depend on elasticity of the stone used,
its density and shape.
Musical pillars are categorised into three
types: The first is called the Shruti Pillar,
as it can produce the basic notes — the
“swaras”. The second type is the Gana
Thoongal, which generates the basic tunes
that make up the “ragas”. The third variety
is the Laya Thoongal pillars that produce
“taal” (beats) when tapped. The pillars at the
Nellaiappar temple are a combination of the
Shruti and Laya types.
Archaeologists date the Nelliappar
temple to the 7th century and claim it was
built by successive rulers of the Pandyan
dynasty.
The musical pillars of Nelliappar and
several other temples in southern India like
those at Hampi (picture), Kanyakumari, and
Thiruvananthapuram are unique to the
country and have no parallel in any other
part of the world.

Fig. 14.16 Superposition of two harmonic waves, one
of frequency 11 Hz (a), and the other of
frequency 9Hz (b), giving rise to beats of
frequency 2 Hz, as shown in (c).

u Example 14.6 Two sitar strings A and B
playing the note ‘Dha’ are slightly out of
tune and produce beats of frequency 5 Hz.
The tension of the string B is slightly
increased and the beat frequency is found
to decrease to 3 Hz. What is the original
frequency of B if the frequency of A is
427 Hz ?

Answer Increase in the tension of a string
increases its frequency. If the original frequency
of B (νB) were greater than that of A (νA ), further
increase in ν B should have resulted in an
increase in the beat frequency. But the beat
frequency is found to decrease. This shows that
νB < νA. Since νA – νB = 5 Hz, and νA = 427 Hz, we
get νB = 422 Hz.

SUMMARY
1.

Mechanical waves can exist in material media and are governed by Newton’s Laws.

2.

Transverse waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate perpendicular
to the direction of wave propagation.

3.

Longitudinal waves are waves in which the particles of the medium oscillate along the
direction of wave propagation.

4.

Progressive wave is a wave that moves from one point of medium to another.

5.

The displacement in a sinusoidal wave propagating in the positive x direction is given
by
y (x, t) = a sin (kx – ω t + φ )
where a is the amplitude of the wave, k is the angular wave number, ω is the angular
frequency, (kx – ω t + φ ) is the phase, and φ is the phase constant or phase angle.

6.

Wavelength λ of a progressive wave is the distance between two consecutive points of
the same phase at a given time. In a stationary wave, it is twice the distance between
two consecutive nodes or antinodes.

7.

Period T of oscillation of a wave is defined as the time any element of the medium
takes to move through one complete oscillation. It is related to the angular frequency ω
through the relation
T =

12.

When two or more waves traverse simultaneously in the same medium, the
displacement of any element of the medium is the algebraic sum of the displacements
due to each wave. This is known as the principle of superposition of waves
n

y = ∑ f i ( x − vt )
i =1

13.

Two sinusoidal waves on the same string exhibit interference, adding or cancelling
according to the principle of superposition. If the two are travelling in the same
direction and have the same amplitude a and frequency but differ in phase by a phase
constant φ, the result is a single wave with the same frequency ω :

1
1
y (x, t) = 2a cos φ  sin  kx − ω t + φ 


2 
2 
If φ = 0 or an integral multiple of 2π, the waves are exactly in phase and the interference
is constructive; if φ = π, they are exactly out of phase and the interference is destructive.
14.

A travelling wave, at a rigid boundary or a closed end, is reflected with a phase
reversal but the reflection at an open boundary takes place without any phase change.
For an incident wave
yi (x, t) = a sin (kx – ωt )
the reflected wave at a rigid boundary is
yr (x, t) = – a sin (kx + ωt )
For reflection at an open boundary
yr (x,t ) = a sin (kx + ωt)

15.

The interference of two identical waves moving in opposite directions produces standing
waves. For a string with fixed ends, the standing wave is given by
y (x, t) = [2a sin kx ] cos ωt
Standing waves are characterised by fixed locations of zero displacement called nodes
and fixed locations of maximum displacements called antinodes. The separation
between two consecutive nodes or antinodes is λ/2.
A stretched string of length L fixed at both the ends vibrates with frequencies given by
v =

nv
,
2L

n = 1, 2, 3, ...

The set of frequencies given by the above relation are called the normal modes of
oscillation of the system. The oscillation mode with lowest frequency is called the
fundamental mode or the first harmonic. The second harmonic is the oscillation mode
with n = 2 and so on.
A pipe of length L with one end closed and other end open (such as air columns)
vibrates with frequencies given by

v
,
n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
2L
The set of frequencies represented by the above relation are the normal modes of
oscillation of such a system. The lowest frequency given by v/4L is the fundamental
mode or the first harmonic.
v = ( n + ½)

16.

A string of length L fixed at both ends or an air column closed at one end and open
at the other end or open at both the ends, vibrates with certain frequencies called
their normal modes. Each of these frequencies is a resonant frequency of the system.

17.

Beats arise when two waves having slightly different frequencies, ν1 and ν2 and
comparable amplitudes, are superposed. The beat frequency is

νbeat = ν1 ~ ν2

POINTS TO PONDER
1.

A wave is not motion of matter as a whole in a medium. A wind is different from the
sound wave in air. The former involves motion of air from one place to the other. The
latter involves compressions and rarefactions of layers of air.

2.

In a wave, energy and not the matter is transferred from one point to the other.

3.

In a mechanical wave, energy transfer takes place because of the coupling through
elastic forces between neighbouring oscillating parts of the medium.

4.

Transverse waves can propagate only in medium with shear modulus of elasticity,
Longitudinal waves need bulk modulus of elasticity and are therefore, possible in all
media, solids, liquids and gases.

5.

In a harmonic progressive wave of a given frequency, all particles have the same
amplitude but different phases at a given instant of time. In a stationary wave, all
particles between two nodes have the same phase at a given instant but have different
amplitudes.

6.

Relative to an observer at rest in a medium the speed of a mechanical wave in that
medium (v) depends only on elastic and other properties (such as mass density) of
the medium. It does not depend on the velocity of the source.
